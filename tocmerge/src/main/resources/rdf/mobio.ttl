This allows two genes with entirely different protein products to share the same nucleotide sequence. The gene overlapping is often found in a compact genome such as HBV and HIV. In human mitochondrial DNA, there are two overlapping genes: ATPase subunits 6 and 8. Figure 5-C-3. An example of gene overlapping. The gene of ATPase subunit 8 is located between 8366 and 8569 of the human mitochondrial genome. The gene of ATPase subunit 6 is located between 8527 and 9204. ATPase 8 contains 68 amino acids while ATPase 6 has 226 amino acids. Their amino acid sequences are different even in the region where they share the same DNA sequence. It is interesting to note that the end of the ATPase 6 gene is not a stop codon, but two nucleotides \"TA\". It becomes the stop codon \"TAA\" only after the poly-A tail is added during RNA processing!  " ;

The following figure shows the chemical structures of a few potent mutagens. Figure 7-F-7 explains the mechanism of mutation by 5-bromouracil. Figure 7-F-6. Structures of potent mutagens. Acridines (e.g., proflavin) are positively charged molecules. They may be inserted between two DNA strands, thereby altering DNA's structure and rigidity. As a result, DNA replication will not be faithful. Alkylating agents are chemicals that add an alkyl group (CnH2n+1) to another molecule. Alkylation of a base may change the normal base pairing. For example, the alkylating agent EMS converts guanine to 7-ethylguanine which pairs with thymine. The mispairing will lead to mutation. Some alkylating agents may also cross-link DNA, resulting in chromosome breaks. Nitrous acid is a deaminating agent that converts cytosine to uracil, adenine to hypoxanthine, and guanine to xanthine. The hydrogen-bonding potential of the modified base is altered, resulting in mispairing. Hydroxylamine and free radicals may modify base structures, resulting in mispairing. Figure 7-F-7. Mechanism of mutation induced by 5-bromouracil. This molecule has two tautomeric isoforms. Its keto form (BUk) pairs with adenine whereas its enol form (BUe) pairs with guanine.

During the second replication, if the keto form undergoes a tautomeric shift to the enol form, it will cause A:T to G:C mutation. Figure 7-F-8. (a) Base structures induced by free radicals.

        txtmod:sectionText     "After RNA molecules (mRNA, tRNA and rRNA) are produced in the nucleus, they must be exported to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis. On the other hand, many proteins operating in the nucleus must be imported from the cytoplasm. The traffic through the nuclear envelope is mediated by a protein family which can be divided into exportins and importins. Binding of a molecule (a \"cargo\") to exportins facilitates its export to the cytoplasm. Importins facilitate import into the nucleus. Figure 5-B-1. Ran, importin and exportin. (a) The two states of Ran: GTP-bound and GDP-bound. (b) General function of importins and exportins. The function of exportins and importins is regulated by a G protein called \"Ran\". There are two types of G proteins: heterotrimeric G proteins and monomeric G proteins (or small G proteins). The latter includes Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran. Like other G proteins, Ran can switch between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. Transition from the GTP-bound to the GDP-bound state is catalyzed by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) which induces hydrolysis of the bound GTP. The reverse transition is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which induces exchange between the bound GDP and the cellular GTP. The GEF of Ran (denoted by RanGEF) is located predominantly in the nucleus while RanGAP is located almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Therefore, in the nucleus Ran will be mainly in the GTP-bound state due to the action of RanGEF while cytoplasmic Ran will be mainly loaded with GDP. This asymmetric distribution has led to the following model for the function of exportins and importins. It is thought that binding between an exportin or importin and its cargo depends on their interaction with Ran: RanGTP enhances binding between an exportin and its cargo but stimulates release of importin's cargo; RanGDT has the opposite effect, namely, it stimulates the release of exportin's cargo, but enhances the binding between an importin and its cargo. Therefore, the exportin and its cargo may move together with RanGTP inside the nucleus, but the cargo will be released as soon as the complex moves into the cytoplasm (through nuclear pores), since RanGTP will be converted to RanGDP in the cytoplasm. By contrast, the importin and its cargo may move together with RanGDP in the cytoplasm, but the cargo will be released in the nucleus since RanGDP will be converted to RanGTP in the nucleus. Protein transport A protein destined for the nucleus and/or cytoplasm contains a specific sequence which can be recognized directly by importin/exportin or through an adaptor protein. For example, importin β is a well characterized importin. It cannot recognize the specific sequence but can be assisted by importin α which is an adaptor. By contrast, the importin for the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) can recognize directly the specific sequence in hnRNP. This importin is named \"transportin\". Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) Two major types of signals have been identified for the nuclear import of proteins: SV40 type and bipartite type. The former was first found in the large T antigen of the SV40 virus. It has the following sequence PKKKRKV This type of signal is characterized by a few consecutive basic residues and in many cases also contains a proline residue. The bipartite type was first identified in Xenopus nucleoplasmin with the following NLS: KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK Its characteristic pattern is: two basic residues, 10 spacer residues, and another basic region consisting of at least 3 basic residues out of 5 residues. Nuclear Export Signal (NES) The signal for nuclear export is a leucine-rich domain which can be recognized by a class of exportins called exportin 1 or Crm1. An example is given below: LQLPPLERLTL This NES is found in the rev protein of HIV-1. Some proteins which need to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm contain both NLS and NES. Examples include the rev protein of HIV-1 and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). The rev protein plays a key role in the regulation of viral expression. NFAT is the target of immunosuppressive drugs widely used in organ transplantation.  " ;

Incorrect regulation of NF-κB may cause inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, viral infection and cancer. Five mammalian NF-κB family members have been identified: NF-κB1 (also called p50) NF-κB2 (also named p52) RelA (also known as p65) RelB c-Rel They all share a highly conserved Rel homology domain, responsible for their dimerization and binding to DNA and IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB). The transcription factor NF-κB works only when two members form a dimer. The most abundant activated form consists of a p50 or p52 subunit and a p65 subunit. Figure 4-H-3. Structure of a NF-κB/DNA complex. The transcription factor NF-κB consists of two subunits: p50 (green) and p65 (red). NF-κB can be activated by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines (such as TNF-α and IL-1), T and B cell mitogens, viral proteins, and stress inducers (such as reactive oxygen species or UV radiation). In the cytoplasm, NF-κB is inhibited by IκB. Upstream activating signal (e.g., binding of TNF-α to its receptor) may cause phosphorylation of IκB by IKK (IκB kinase). This triggers the degradation of IκB through the ubiquitin system, where the target molecule is masked by a chain of ubiquitins for degradation by the 26S protesome. The free NF-κB can then translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. Figure 4-H-4. Activation of NF-κB.  " ;

Although all of the cells in the human body contain identical genetic material, the same genes are not active in every cell. Studying which genes are active and which are inactive in different cell types helps scientists to understand both how these cells function normally and how they are affected when various genes do not perform properly. In the past, scientists have only been able to conduct these genetic analyses on a few genes at once. With the development of DNA microarray technology, however, scientists can now examine how active thousands of genes are at any given time. What is DNA microarray technology used for? Microarray technology will help researchers to learn more about many different diseases, including heart disease, mental illness and infectious diseases, to name only a few. One intense area of microarray research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the study of cancer. In the past, scientists have classified different types of cancers based on the organs in which the tumors develop. With the help of microarray technology, however, they will be able to further classify these types of cancers based on the patterns of gene activity in the tumor cells. Researchers will then be able to design treatment strategies targeted directly to each specific type of cancer. Additionally, by examining the differences in gene activity between untreated and treated tumor cells - for example those that are radiated or oxygen-starved - scientists will understand exactly how different therapies affect tumors and be able to develop more effective treatments. How does DNA microarray technology work? Figure 9-F-1. Illustration for DNA microarray. [Source: National Human Genome Research Institute] DNA microarrays are created by robotic machines that arrange minuscule amounts of hundreds or thousands of gene sequences on a single microarray slide (a glass chip or other solid surface). Researchers have a database of over 40,000 gene sequences that they can use for this purpose. When a gene is activated, cellular machinery begins to copy certain segments of that gene. The resulting product is known as messenger RNA (mRNA), which is the body's template for creating proteins. The mRNA produced by the cell is complementary, and therefore will bind to the original portion of the DNA strand from which it was copied. To determine which genes are turned on and which are turned off in a given cell, a researcher must first collect the messenger RNA molecules present in that cell. The researcher then labels each mRNA molecule by using a reverse transcriptase enzyme (RT) that generates a complementary cDNA to the mRNA. During that process fluorescent nucleotides are attached to the cDNA. The tumor and the normal samples are labeled with different fluorescent dyes. Next, the researcher places the labeled cDNAs onto a DNA microarray slide . The labeled cDNAs that represent mRNAs in the cell will then hybridize – or bind – to their synthetic complementary DNAs attached on the microarray slide, leaving its fluorescent tag. A researcher must then use a special scanner to measure the fluorescent intensity for each spot/areas on the microarray slide. If a particular gene is very active, it produces many molecules of messenger RNA, thus, more labeled cDNAs, which hybridize to the DNA on the microarray slide and generate a very bright fluorescent area. Genes that are somewhat less active produce fewer mRNAs, thus, less labeled cDNAs, which results in dimmer fluorescent spots. If there is no fluorescence, none of the messenger molecules have hybridized to the DNA, indicating that the gene is inactive. Researchers frequently use this technique to examine the activity of various genes at different times. When co-hybridizing Tumor samples (Red Dye) and Normal sample (Green dye) together, they will compete for the synthetic complementary DNAs on the microarray slide. As a result, if the spot is red, this means that that specific gene is more expressed in tumor than in normal (up-regulated in cancer). If a spot is Green, that means that that gene is more expressed in the Normal tissue (Down regulated in cancer). If a spot is yellow that means that that specific gene is equally expressed in normal and tumor.   [Courtesy: National Human Genome Research Institute.]  " ;

The HIV mRNAs are produced from the primary transcript by three different splicings: unspliced, singly spliced and doubly spliced. Although unspliced and singly sliced mRNAs are made before doubly spliced mRNAs, the protein products of the doubly spliced mRNAs are the first synthesized in the cytoplasm because they are smaller and exported faster. As a matter of fact, expression of unspliced and singly sliced mRNAs would be negligible without the rev protein which is a product of the doubly spliced mRNA. Figure 5-B-2. The role of the HIV rev protein. (a) The rev protein is a product of the doubly spliced mRNA. Without rev, export of unspliced and singly spliced mRNAs (I and II) is very slow. (b) The rev protein can bind to the rev-response-element (RRE) of mRNA I and II, accelerating their export. (c) Sequences of NLS and NES in the rev proten. A rev protein consists of 116 amino acids, including a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and a nuclear export sequence (NES). The 3D structure of rev is not known yet. However, the hydrophilic NLS is likely to be more exposed than the hydrophobic NES. Therefore, when rev is synthesized in the cytoplasm, the importin α/β may bind to its NLS, carrying it into the nucleus. Even if NLS and NES are equally exposed, the action of Ran still favors the binding of the cytoplasmic rev to importin, rather than exportin. When rev is in the nucleus, it can bind to mRNA's RRE. The RNA binding domain of rev is in the same region as NLS. Thus, upon binding to mRNA, the NLS of rev is masked, exposing only NES. This facilitates the export of the rev/mRNA complex by the exportin Crm1.  " ;

There are two types of G proteins: heterotrimeric G proteins and monomeric G proteins (or small G proteins). G-protein-coupled receptors are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. Figure 6-D-2. The structure of heterotrimeric G protein, consisting of three subunits: α, β and γ. Note that in the inactive state, the α subunit binds to GDP (guanosine diphosphate). The heterotrimeric G protein consists of three subunits: α, β and γ. Based on the differences in their genes, 20 α, 6 β and 12 γ subunits have been identified. Their molecular weights are in the following ranges: α subunit: 39 - 46 kD β subunit: 35 - 39 kD γ subunit: ~ 8 kD In the inactive state, the α subunit binds to GDP and the three subunits are attached together (see above figure). When the α subunit binds to GTP, its affinity to the βγ subunits is decreased, resulting in their dissociation. The separated α and/or βγ subunits can then interact with their effectors. Cycling of G protein between active and inactive states Figure 6-D-3. Cycling of G protein between active and inactive states. (a) In the inactive state, Gα binds to GDP (guanosine diphosphate). (b) Interaction between Gα and the agonist-stimulated receptor causes the release of GDP. GTP then binds to the empty site because its concentration in the cell is higher than GDP. (c) The GTP-bound Gα has low affinity to βγ subunits, resulting in their dissociation. (d) GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP because Gα has GTPase activity.  " ;

Base excision DNA's bases may be modified by deamination or alkylation. The position of the modified (damaged) base is called the \"abasic site\" or \"AP site\". In E.coli, the DNA glycosylase can recognize the AP site and remove its base. Then, the AP endonuclease removes the AP site and neighboring nucleotides. The gap is filled by DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase. Figure 7-G-1. DNA repair by base excision. Nucleotide excision In E. coli, proteins UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC are involved in removing the damaged nucleotides (e.g., the dimer induced by UV light). The gap is then filled by DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase. In yeast, the proteins similar to Uvr's are named RADxx (\"RAD\" stands for \"radiation\"), such as RAD3, RAD10. etc. Figure 7-G-2. DNA repair by nucleotide excision. Mismatch repair To repair mismatched bases, the system has to know which base is the correct one. In E. coli, this is achieved by a special methylase called the \"Dam methylase\", which can methylate all adenines that occur within (5')GATC sequences. Immediately after DNA replication, the template strand has been methylated, but the newly synthesized strand is not methylated yet. Thus, the template strand and the new strand can be distinguished. Figure 7-G-3. Mismatch repair. The repairing process begins with the protein MutS which binds to mismatched base pairs. Then, MutL is recruited to the complex and activates MutH which binds to GATC sequences. Activation of MutH cleaves the unmethylated strand at the GATC site. Subsequently, the segment from the cleavage site to the mismatch is removed by exonuclease (with assistance from helicase II and SSB proteins). If the cleavage occurs on the 3' side of the mismatch, this step is carried out by exonuclease I (which degrades a single strand only in the 3' to 5' direction). If the cleavage occurs on the 5' side of the mismatch, exonuclease VII or RecJ is used to degrade the single stranded DNA. The gap is filled by DNA polymerase III and DNA ligase. The distance between the GATC site and the mismatch could be as long as 1,000 base pairs. Therefore, mismatch repair is very expensive and inefficient. Mismatch repair in eukaryotes may be similar to that in E. coli. Homologs of MutS and MutL have been identified in yeast, mammals, and other eukaryotes. MSH1 to MSH5 are homologous to MutS; MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2 are homologous to MutL. Mutations of MSH2, PMS1 and PMS2 are related to colon cancer. In eukaryotes, the mechanism to distinguish the template strand from the new strand is still unclear.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "By definition, organelles are the membrane-bound structures in a cell. The nucleus is an example. Other organelles are located in the cytoplasm such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes, lysosomes, vacuoles and glyoxisomes. Mitochondria An eukaryotic cell contains many mitochondria, occupying up to a quarter of the cytoplasmic volume. The size of a mitochondrion is about 1.5-2 μm in length, 0.5-1 μm in diameter, approximately the same as E. coli. It has two membranes: outer membrane and inner membrane. Mitochondria also have their own DNA (represented as mtDNA), which encodes some of the proteins and RNAs in mitochondria. However, most proteins operating in mitochondria still originate from nuclear DNA. The major role of mitochondria is to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which carries high energy to power most cellular processes. Such energy is stored in the phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP. During ATP hydrolysis, the bond is broken, releasing 7.3 kcal/mole of energy. Many cellular processes can utilize the released energy by coupling with the ATP hydrolysis. In animal cells, the major sources for the synthesis of ATP are fatty acids and glucose. Oxidation of an 18-carbon fatty acid can make 146 ATP molecules. By contrast, oxidation of one glucose molecule (6 carbons) can generate only 36 ATP molecules. The generation of ATP involves a series of electron transport. Inevitably, electrons may leak from the electron transport chain, producing free radicals. This has been suggested to be the major mechanism involved in the aging process. See \"Mitochondria, Apoptosis and Aging\". Chloroplasts Like mitochondria, a chloroplast also contains both outer and inner membranes on its surface. Inside the chloroplast, there are many thylakoids, each is enclosed by a membrane. Chlorophylls are located on the thylakoid membrane to absorb light for photosynthesis. In the first step of photosynthesis, light energy is used to split water into hydrogen ions and oxygen molecules. The generated hydrogen ions will create a concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane. Movement of hydrogen ions through the membrane is coupled to ATP synthesis. The overall reactions can be written as Like mitochondria, chloroplasts also have their own DNA, but most chloroplast proteins are still encoded by nuclear DNA. Endoplasmic reticulum Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be divided into rough ER and smooth ER. The major role of rough ER is to process the newly synthesized peptides from ribosomes. Therefore, the surface of rough ER is usually associated with ribosomes and thus appears \"rough\". Smooth ER is involved in the synthesis and metabolism of lipids. Hepatocytes are abundant in smooth ER. Golgi apparatus Golgi apparatus is a major site for sorting and modifications of proteins and lipids. After proteins are sorted at rough ER, they are enclosed in transport vesicles and carried to the Golgi apparatus. Some proteins could be modified into glycoproteins and then transported to other destinations. Peroxisomes Peroxisomes contain enzymes for degrading amino acids and fatty acids. These reactions produce harmful hydrogen peroxide. Hence, peroxisomes also contain catalase to convert hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen: Lysosomes The major function of lysosomes is to degrade various macromolecules in the cell. They contain nuclease for degrading DNA and RNA, protease for degrading proteins and other enzymes for degrading polysacchrides and lipids. Lysosomes exist only in animal cells. Although plant cells do not have lysosomes, their vacuoles are also capable of degrading macromolecules. Vacuoles Vacuoles store small molecules such as water, ions, sucrose and amino acids. They can also hold waste products which will be slowly degraded. They typically occupy more than 30% of the cell volume, but may expand up to 90%. Glyoxisomes Glyoxisomes are found mainly in plant seeds. Their major function is to convert fatty acids into acetyl CoA for the glyoxylate cycle where two acetyl-CoA molecules are converted to a 4-carbon dicarboxylic acid. Peroxisomes and glyoxisomes are also called microbodies.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "In general, cloning means the creation of a perfect replica. Typically, the word is used to describe the creation of a genetically identical copy. In biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to copy short stretches of DNA—a process that is referred to as molecular cloning. Cloning allows for the creation of multiple copies of genes, expression of genes, and study of specific genes. To get the DNA fragment into a bacterial cell in a form that will be copied or expressed, the fragment is first inserted into a plasmid. A plasmid (also called a vector in this context) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA in bacteria. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a \"vehicle\" in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Modified plasmids are usually reintroduced into a bacterial host for replication. As the bacteria divide, they copy their own DNA (including the plasmids). The inserted DNA fragment is copied along with the rest of the bacterial DNA. In a bacterial cell, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or another organism that is being studied) is referred to as foreign DNA to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium (the host DNA). Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been highly engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and for the subsequent large-scale production of important molecules, such as insulin. A valuable characteristic of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced. These plasmid vectors contain many short DNA sequences that can be cut with different commonly available restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes (also called restriction endonucleases) recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction enzymes make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- to 4-nucleotide single-stranded overhang. The sequence that is recognized by the restriction enzyme is a four- to eight-nucleotide sequence that is a palindrome. Like with a word palindrome, this means the sequence reads the same forward and backward. In most cases, the sequence reads the same forward on one strand and backward on the complementary strand. When a staggered cut is made in a sequence like this, the overhangs are complementary. Because these overhangs are capable of coming back together by hydrogen bonding with complementary overhangs on a piece of DNA cut with the same restriction enzyme, these are called “sticky ends.” The process of forming hydrogen bonds between complementary sequences on single strands to form double-stranded DNA is called annealing. Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase, which takes part in DNA replication in cells, permanently joins the DNA fragments when the sticky ends come together. In this way, any DNA fragment can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction enzyme. Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they contain new combinations of genetic material. Proteins that are produced from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins.   [Source: OpenStax College.]  " ;

To enter a host cell, the HIV's surface protein gp120 must interact with two receptors: CD4 and a chemokine receptor (e.g., CCR5). The antibody shown here can block the effects of chemokine receptors. Its position is likely to be the binding site of chemokine receptors in the normal process. Interaction between gp120 and these two receptors triggers the fusion between viral and host membranes. The detailed mechanism is not entirely clear. It is possible that CD4 and/or chemokine receptors may pull gp120 away, exposing gp41, which is linked to gp120 and embedded in the viral membrane. gp41 is a fusion protein, capable of initiating membrane fusion, thereby allowing the entry of HIV into the host cell.  " ;

The chemical reaction is similar to the synthesis of RNA strands (Chapter 4 Section B). Both DNA and RNA polymerases can extend nucleic acid strands only in the 5' to 3' direction. However, the two strands in a DNA molecule are antiparallel. Therefore, only one strand (leading strand) can be synthesized continuously by the DNA polymerase. The other strand (lagging strand) is synthesized segment by segment (more info). Figure 7-B-1. The structure formed by two β subunits of the E. coli DNA polymerase III. This structure can clamp a DNA molecule and slide with the core polymerase along the DNA molecule. DNA polymerases E. Coli Three types of DNA polymerases exist in E. coli: I, II and III. The DNA polymerase I is used to fill the gap between DNA fragments of the lagging strand. It is also the major enzyme for gap filling during DNA repair. The DNA polymerase II is encoded by the PolB gene, which is involved in the SOS response to DNA damage. DNA replication is mainly carried out by the DNA polymerase III. The DNA polymerase III consists of several subunits, with a total molecular weight exceeding 600kD. Among them, α, ε, and θ subunits constitute the core polymerase. The major role of other subunits is to keep the enzyme from falling off the template strand. As shown in Figure 7-B-1, two β subunits can form a donut-shaped structure to clamp a DNA molecule in its center, and slide with the core polymerase along the DNA molecule. This allows continuous polymerization of up to 5 x 105 nucleotides. In the absence of β subunits, the core polymerase would fall off the template strand after synthesizing 10-50 nucleotides. Mammals There are five types of DNA polymerases in mammalian cells: α, β, γ, σ, and ε. The γ subunit is located in the mitochondria, responsible for the replication of mtDNA. Other subunits are located in the nucleus. Their major roles are given below: α: synthesis of lagging strand. β: DNA repair. σ: synthesis of leading strand. ε: DNA repair.  " ;

Acidic: including aspartic acid (aspartate) and glutamatic acid (glutamate). In a neutral solution, the R group of an acidic amino acid may lose a proton and become negatively charged. 2. Basic: including lysine, arginine and histidine. In a neutral solution, the R group of a basic amino acid may gain a proton and become positively charged. Interaction between positive and negative R groups may form a salt bridge, which is an important stabilizing force in proteins. 3. Aromatic: including tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine. Their R groups contain an aromatic ring. 4. Sulfur: including cysteine and methionine. Their R groups contain a sulfur atom (S). The disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues provides a strong force for stabilizing the globular structure. A unique feature about methionine is that the synthesis of all peptide chains starts from methionine (Chapter 5 Section C). 5. Uncharged hydrophilic: including serine, threonine, asparagine and glutamine. Their R groups are hydrophilic and capable of forming hydrogen bonds. 6. Inactive hydrophobic: including glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine. These amino acids are more likely to be buried in the protein interior. Their R groups do not form hydrogen bonds and rarely participate in chemical reactions. 7. Special structure: including proline. In most amino acids, the R group and the amino group are not directly connected. Proline is the only exception among 20 amino acids found in protein. Due to this special feature, proline is often located at the turn of a peptide chain in the three-dimensional structure of a protein. Figure 2-A-2. Names, symbols, chemical structures and hydrophobicity indices of the 20 amino acids found in proteins. They are arranged in the order as discussed above. Note: The hydrophobicity index tells the relative hydrophobicity among amino acids. More positive value indicates stronger hydrophobicity. Hydrophilic amino acids have negative values. In a protein, hydrophobic amino acids are more likely to be located in the protein interior, whereas hydrophilic amino acids are more likely to face the aqueous environment.  " ;

In the lytic cycle, λ phages replicate rapidly and eventually cause lysis of the host cell. In the lysogenic cycle, the viral DNA circularizes and integrates into the host DNA. Then, λ phages may replicate with the host cell. Under certain conditions (e.g., ultraviolet irradiation of cells), the λ phages may transform from the lysogenic cycle to the lytic cycle. This transformation is mainly controlled by two proteins: cI (also known as λ repressor) and Cro. Increase in cI proteins promotes the lysogenic cycle whereas increase in Cro proteins promotes the lytic cycle. The detailed mechanism is explained in Chapter 4 Section H. Figure 1-F-1.

When a tRNA is brought to the ribosome by the pairing between its anticodon and the mRNA's codon, the amino acid attached at its 3' end will be added to the growing peptide. In bacteria, there are 30-40 tRNAs with different anticodons. In animal and plant cells, about 50 different tRNAs are found. However, there are 61 codons coded for amino acids. Suppose each codon can pair with only a unique anticodon, then 61 tRNAs would be needed. Figure 5-C-4. Pairing between tRNA's anticodon and mRNA's codon. The left figure defines the wobble position where base pairing does not obey the standard rule. The right tables show all possible base pairings at the wobble position. For example, guanine (G) can pair with both cytosine (C) and uracil (U) ; inosine (I) can pair with cytosine, adenine and uracil. Wobble pairing The reason why less than 61 tRNAs are required is because of the \"wobble pairing\" between anticodon and codon. As shown in the following figure, base pairing does not obey the standard Watson-Crick pairing at the wobble position. One base can pair with several other bases. Figure 5-C-5. The non-standard base pairing at the wobble position. Aminoacyl-tRNA The tRNA together with the amino acid attached to its 3' end is called an aminoacyl-tRNA. The attached amino acid is encoded by the codon which matches the tRNA's anticodon. Therefore, only a specific amino acid may be attached to the 3' end of a given tRNA. The process is catalyzed by a class of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which recognize the anticodon and its compatible amino acid. A cell has 20 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each can add only one of 20 amino acids to a compatible tRNA. Let us use arginine as an example to explain the notation of aminoacyl-tRNA. \"Arg-tRNA\" denotes the tRNA with arginine attached while \"tRNAArg\" specifies the tRNA which contains the anticodon for the codon of arginine. \"Arg-tRNAArg\" represents the arginine-specific tRNA with arginine attached.  " ;

It has been estimated that uncorrected replication errors occur with a frequency of 10-9 - 10-11 for each nucleotide added by DNA polymerases. Since a cell division requires synthesis of 6 X 109 nucleotides, the mutation rate is about one per cell division. A commonly observed replication error is the replication slippage, which occurs at the repetitive sequences when the new strand mispairs with the template strand. The microsatellite polymorphism is mainly caused by the replication slippage. If the mutation occurs in a coding region, it could produce abnormal proteins, leading to diseases. The Huntington's disease is a well known example. Figure 7-F-3.The mutation caused by replication slippage. In this figure, mispairing involves only one repeat.

However, a polycistronic mRNA should contain multiple initiating codons (see the figure below). On the other hand, a peptide may also contain several non-initiating methionine residues, also encoded by AUG. How could the system distinguish them? The answer lies in the initiation signals. Figure 5-C-1. Expression of a bacterial operon. In this example, an mRNA encodes more than one peptide. Such mRNA is called polycistronic. Some bacterial mRNAs are polycistronic, but nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs are monocistronic (encodes a single peptide). The synthesized peptide sequence is a translation of mRNA sequence according to the genetic code. It starts from the initiation codon, and then follows the mRNA sequence in a strictly \"three nucleotides for one amino acid\" manner. Therefore, a minor change in the mRNA sequence could produce a very different peptide. For instance, if a codon which codes for an amino acid is changed to a \"stop\" codon, the subsequent sequence will not be translated (e.g., Figure 5-A-9). Another example is the \"frameshift\". The translation is carried out by tRNA. The entire procedure of protein synthesis includes initiation, elongation and termination.  " ;

Defective p53 could allow abnormal cells to proliferate, resulting in cancer. As many as 50% of all human tumors contain p53 mutants. In normal cells, the p53 protein level is low. DNA damage and other stress signals may trigger the increase of p53 proteins, which have three major functions: growth arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis (cell death). The growth arrest stops the progression of cell cycle, preventing replication of damaged DNA. During the growth arrest, p53 may activate the transcription of proteins involved in DNA repair. Apoptosis is the \"last resort\" to avoid proliferation of cells containing abnormal DNA. The cellular concentration of p53 must be tightly regulated. While it can suppress tumors, high level of p53 may accelerate the aging process by excessive apoptosis. The major regulator of p53 is Mdm2, which can trigger the degradation of p53 by the ubiquitin system. Target Genes p53 is a transcriptional activator, regulating the expression of Mdm2 (for its own regulation) and the genes involved in growth arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. Some important examples are listed below. Growth arrest: p21, Gadd45, and 14-3-3σ. DNA repair: p53R2. Apoptosis: Bax, Apaf-1, PUMA and NoxA. Regulation of p53 As mentioned above, p53 is mainly regulated by Mdm2. The regulation mechanism is illustrated in the following figure. Figure 4-H-5. Regulation of p53. (a) Expression of Mdm2 is activated by p53. (b) Binding of p53 by Mdm2 can trigger the degradation of p53 via the ubiquitin system. (c) Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, Thr18 or Ser20 will disrupt its binding with Mdm2. In normal cells, these three residues are not phosphorylated, and p53 is maintained at low level by Mdm2. (d) DNA damage may activate protein kinase (such as ATM, DNA-PK, or CHK2) to phosphorylate p53 at one of these three residues, thereby increasing p53 level. Since Mdm2 expression is activated by p53, the increase of p53 also increases Mdm2, but they have no effect while p53 is phosphorylated. After the DNA damage is repaired, the ATM kinase is no longer active. p53 will be quickly dephosphorylated and destroyed by the accumulated Mdm2. Roles of p53 The roles of p53 in growth arrest and apoptosis are illustrated in Figure 4-H-6. p53 is also directly involved in DNA repair. One of its transcriptional target gene, p53R2, encodes ribonucleotide reductase, which is important for both DNA replication and repair. p53 also interacts directly with AP endonuclease and DNA polymerase which are involved in base excision repair. Figure 4-H-6. The roles of p53 in growth arrest and apoptosis. (a) The cell cycle progression into the S phase requires the enzyme Cdk2, which can be inhibited by p21. The progression into the M phase requires Cdc2 which can be inhibited by p21, GADD45 or 14-3-3σ. p53 regulates the expression of these inhibitory proteins to induce growth arrest. (b) Apoptosis can be induced by the binding of Caspase 9 to cytochrome c and Apaf1. p53 may activate the expression of Apaf1 and Bax. The latter can then stimulate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (see Mitochondria, Apoptosis and Aging).  " ;

In cells, such process has been found in the ligation between two nucleic acid fragments. However, the whole nucleic acid chain is usually synthesized by RNA polymerase or DNA polymerase. Figure 3-A-5. Formation of the phosphodiester bond through the condensation reaction. Like peptide chains, a nucleic acid chain also has orientation: its 5' end contains a free phosphate group and 3' end contains a free hydroxyl group. Synthesis of a nucleic acid chain always proceeds from 5' to 3'. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, the sequence of a nucleic acid chain is written from 5' to 3' (left to right). Figure 3-A-6.

A DNA molecule typically contains two strands whereas most RNA molecules contain a single strand. The length of a nucleic acid chain is represented by the number of bases. In the case of a double-stranded nucleic acid, bases are paired between two strands. Therefore, its length is given by the number of base pairs (bp). 1 kb = 1000 bases or bp; 1 Mb = 1 million bases or bp.

However, there is a major difference between the two classes of enzymes: RNA polymerases can initiate a new strand but DNA polymerases cannot. Therefore, during DNA replication, an oligonucleotide (called primer) should first be synthesized by a different enzyme. The chemical reaction catalyzed by RNA polymerases is shown in Figure 4-B-2. The nucleotides used to extend a growing RNA chain are ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Two phosphate groups are released as pyrophosphate (PPi) during the reaction. Strand growth is always in the 5' to 3' direction. The first nucleotide at the 5' end retains its triphosphate group (Figure 4-B-3). Figure 4-B-2. The chemical reaction catalyzed by RNA polymerases. Figure 4-B-3. Simplified presentation for the chain elongation. The vertical line represents the pentose and the slanting line denotes the phosphodiester bond. Bases are designated as N1, N2, etc. Classes of RNA polymerases E. coli An E. coli RNA polymerase is composed of five subunits: two α subunits, and one for each β, β', and σ subunit. β (151 kD) and β' (156 kD) are significantly larger than α (37 kD). Several different forms of σ subunits have been identified, with molecular weights ranging from 28 kD to 70 kD. The σ subunit is also known as the σ factor. It plays an important role in recognizing the transcriptional initiation site, and also possesses the helicase activity to unwind the DNA double helix. Nucleotide synthesis is carried out by other four subunits, which together are called the core polymerase. The term holoenzyme refers to a complete and fully functional enzyme. In this case, the holoenzyme includes the core polymerase and the σ factor. Eukaryotes There are three classes of eukaryotic RNA polymerases: I, II and III, each comprising two large subunits and 12-15 smaller subunits. The two large subunits are homologous to the E. coli β and β' subunits. Two smaller subunits are similar to the E. coli α subunit. However, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase does not contain any subunit similar to the E. coli σ factor. Therefore, in eukaryotes, transcriptional initiation should be mediated by other proteins. RNA polymerase II is involved in the transcription of all protein genes and most snRNA genes. It is undoubtedly the most important among the three classes of RNA polymerases. The other two classes transcribe only RNA genes. RNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, transcribing rRNA genes except 5S rRNA. RNA polymerase III is located outside the nucleolus, transcribing 5S rRNA, tRNA, U6 snRNA and some small RNA genes.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "\"Vector\" is an agent that can carry a DNA fragment into a host cell. If used for reproducing the DNA fragment, it is called a cloning vector. If used for expressing certain gene in the DNA fragment, it is called an expression vector. Commonly used vectors include plasmid, Lambda phage, cosmid and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). Plasmid Plasmids are circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that exist in bacteria and in the nuclei of some eukaryotic cells. They can replicate independently of the host cell. The size of plasmids ranges from a few kb to near 100 kb. Figure 9-A-3. A typical plasmid vector. It contains a polylinker which can recognize several different restriction enzymes, an ampicillin-resistance gene (ampr) for selective amplification, and a replication origin (ORI) for proliferation in the host cell. A plasmid vector is made from natural plasmids by removing unnecessary segments and adding essential sequences. To clone a DNA sample, the same restriction enzyme must be used to cut both the vector and the DNA sample. Therefore, a vector usually contains a sequence (polylinker) which can recognize several restriction enzymes so that the vector can be used for cloning a variety of DNA samples. A plasmid vector must also contain a drug-resistance gene for selective amplification. After the vector enters into a host cell, it may proliferate with the host cell. However, since the transformation efficiency of plasmids in E. coli is very low, most E. coli cells that proliferate in the medium would not contain the plasmids. Therefore, we must find a way to allow only the transformed E. coli to proliferate. Typically, antibiotics are used to kill E. coli cells which do not contain the vectors. The transformed E. coli cells are protected by the ampicillin-resistance gene (ampr) which can express the enzyme, β-lactamase, to inactivate the antibiotic ampicillin. Lambda Phage λ phages are viruses that can infect bacteria. The major advantage of the λ phage vector is its high transformation efficiency, about 1000 times more efficient than the plasmid vector. Figure 9-A-4. Schematic drawing of the DNA cloning using λ phages as vectors. The DNA to be cloned is first inserted into the λ DNA, replacing a nonessential region. Then, by an in vitro assembly system (described below), the λ virion carrying the recombinant DNA can be formed. The λ genome is 49 kb in length which can carry up to 25 kb foreign DNA. Figure 9-A-5. The assembly process of the λ virion. The extreme ends of the λ DNA are known as COS sites, each is single stranded, 12 nucleotides long. Because their sequences are complementary to each other, one end of λ DNA may base-pair with the other end of a different λ DNA, forming concatemers. The two ends of a λ DNA may also bind together, forming a circular DNA. In the host cell, the λ DNA circularizes because ligase may seal the join of the COS sites. In the assembly process of λ virions, two proteins Nu1 and A can recognize the COS site, directing the insertion of the λ DNA between them into an empty head. The filled head is then attached to the tail, forming a complete λ virion. The whole process normally takes place in the host cell. However, to prepare the λ virion carrying recombinant λ DNA, the following in vitro assembly system is commonly used. Proteins Nu1 and A are encoded by the genes in the λ genome. If the two genes are mutated, λ DNA cannot be packaged into the pre-assembled head. Because tails attach only to filled heads, the cell will accumulate separate empty heads and tails, which can then be extracted. When the extract is mixed with recombinant λ DNA and proteins Nu1 and A, the complete λ virion carrying recombinant λ DNA will be assembled. Cosmid The cosmid vector is a combination of the plasmid vector and the COS site which allows the target DNA to be inserted into the λ head. It has the following advantages: High transformation efficiency. The cosmid vector can carry up to 45 kb whereas plasmid and λ phage vectors are limited to 25 kb. Figure 9-A-6. Cloning by using cosmid vectors. (a) In addition to ampr, ORI, and polylinker as in the plasmid vector, the cosmid vector also contains a COS site. (b) After cosmid vectors are cleaved with restriction enzyme, they are ligated with DNA fragments. The subsequent assembly and transformation steps are the same as cloning with λ phages. YAC The yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector is capable of carrying a large DNA fragment (up to 2 Mb), but its transformation efficiency is very low. Figure 9-A-7. Cloning by using YAC vector. Essential components of YAC vectors Centromers (CEN), telomeres (TEL) and autonomous replicating sequence (ARS) for proliferation in the host cell. ampr for selective amplification and markers such as TRP1 and URA3 for identifying cells containing the YAC vector. Recognition sites of restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoRI and BamHI) Procedure The target DNA is partially digested by EcoRI and the YAC vector is cleaved by EcoRI and BamHI. Ligate the cleaved vector segments with a digested DNA fragment to form an artificial chromosome. Transform yeast cells to make a large number of copies.  " ;

Compared to the old techniques, gel electrophoresis and chromatography, protein microarray is much more efficient in proteomics. Protein microarray has two basic formats: forward phase and reverse phase. Forward phase protein microarray Antibodies or other proteins are arrayed at defined positions on a glass slide or other support surface. The array is then probed with a variety of molecules, such as protein lysate, enzymes, small molecules and nucleic acids. Analysis of the resulting binding reactions can provide information about expression levels of particular proteins in the sample as well as binding affinities and specificities. Rreverse phase protein microarray Protein lysate is arrayed onto the microarray slide and probed with antibodies against the target protein of interest.  " ;

The watery fluid of the blastocoel is secreted by trophoblast cells and transported in from the exterior. For the human, the blastocyst is formed by days 5 to 6 after fertilization. At this time, the blastocyst has reached the uterus, but has not yet implanted into the uterine wall. On day 5, preimplantation human embryo contains 200 to 250 cells, only 30 to 34 of which are inner cell mass cells.

        txtmod:sectionText     "Organ transplantation often elicits immune responses to reject the foreign object. The most widely used drugs to deal with such graft reaction are FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA). Their direct target is a phosphatase known as calcineurin. CsA combines with a cellular protein called cyclophilin to inhibit calcineurin; FK506 combines with FKBP (FK506 binding protein) to inhibit the phosphatase. How can inhibition of a phosphatase suppress the immune response? The answer lies in the transport of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) which is a transcription factor regulating IL-2. NFAT contains both nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and nuclear export sequence (NES), but one of them is buried in the protein interior, inaccessible to importin and exportin. Whether NLS or NES is masked depends on the phosphorylation state of specific serine residues in the regulatory domain. Phosphorylation of these serine residues exposes NES whereas dephosphorylation exposes NLS. In resting cells, the NLS of the cytoplasmic NFAT is masked due to phosphorylation on these serine residues. In stimulated cells, an increase of intracellular calcium ions activates calcineurin, which then dephosphorylates the masking residues. Consequently, NLS is exposed and NFAT can be carried into the nucleus by the importin α/β. Inside the nucleus, NFAT may be re-phosphorylated by protein kinase, exposing its NES and be exported by the exportin Crm1. Figure 5-B-3. The action of the immunosuppressive drug FK506. (a) The structure of the FK506-FKBP-calcineurin complex. PDB ID = 1TCO. (b) In the normal process, calcineurin may dephosphorylate NFAT, exposing its NLS so that NFAT can move into the nucleus to stimulate the expression of IL-2, inducing a cascade of immune responses. If calcineurin is inhibited, the immune response will be suppressed.  " ;

The βγ subunits may act on adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase A2, phospholipase C, ion channels, calcium ATPase etc. Adenylyl cyclase Adenylyl cylase (also known as \"adenylate cyclase\") catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, which is an important \"second messenger\". See The cAMP Signaling Pathway. Phospholipase A2 Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) cleaves phospholipids, generating arachidonic acid directly (see Figure 6-B-3). Signaling by arachidonic acid is discussed in Section B. Phospholipase C Phospholipase C (PLC) also cleaves phospholipids, but at a different site than PLA2, thereby generating diacylglycerol (DAG). There are many types of PLC: β, γ, δ and others. The effector of G protein α and βγ subunits is PLC-β. Figure 6-D-4.

        txtmod:sectionText     "Example of Normal Growth To illustrate what is meant by normal growth control, consider the skin. The thin outermost layer of normal skin, called the epidermis, is roughly a dozen cells thick. Cells in the bottom row of this layer, called the basal layer, divide just fast enough to replenish cells that are continually being shed from the surface of the skin. Each time one of these basal cells divides, it produces two cells. One remains in the basal layer and retains the capacity to divide. The other migrates out of the basal layer and loses the capacity to divide. The number of dividing cells in the basal layer, therefore, stays the same. The Beginning of Cancerous Growth During the development of skin cancer, the normal balance between cell division and cell loss is disrupted. The basal cells now divide faster than is needed to replenish the cells being shed from the surface of the skin. Each time one of these basal cells divides, the two newly formed cells will often retain the capacity to divide, thereby leading to an increase in the total number of dividing cells. Tumors (Neoplasms) This gradual increase in the number of dividing cells creates a growing mass of tissue called a \"tumor\" or \"neoplasm.\" If the rate of cell division is relatively rapid, and no \"suicide\" signals are in place to trigger cell death, the tumor will grow quickly in size; if the cells divide more slowly, tumor growth will be slower. But regardless of the growth rate, tumors ultimately increase in size because new cells are being produced in greater numbers than needed. As more and more of these dividing cells accumulate, the normal organization of the tissue gradually becomes disrupted. Invasion and Metastasis Cancers are capable of spreading throughout the body by two mechanisms: invasion and metastasis. Invasion refers to the direct migration and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues. Metastasis refers to the ability of cancer cells to penetrate into lymphatic and blood vessels, circulate through the bloodstream, and then invade normal tissues elsewhere in the body. Malignant versus Benign Tumors Depending on whether or not they can spread by invasion and metastasis, tumors are classified as being either benign or malignant. Benign tumors are tumors that cannot spread by invasion or metastasis; hence, they only grow locally. Malignant tumors are tumors that are capable of spreading by invasion and metastasis. By definition, the term \"cancer\" applies only to malignant tumors.   [This page was adapted from National Cancer Institute.]  " ;

The genes in a genome do not have any effect on cellular functions until they are expressed. Different types of cells express different sets of genes, thereby exhibiting various shapes and functions. Figure 4-A-1. Essential steps involved in the expression of protein genes. Gene expression means the production of a protein or a functional RNA from its gene. Several steps are required: Transcription: A DNA strand is used as a template to synthesize a complementary RNA strand, which is called the primary transcript. RNA processing: This step involves modifications of the primary transcript to generate a mature mRNA (for protein genes) or a functional tRNA or rRNA. For RNA genes (tRNA and rRNA), the expression is complete after a functional tRNA or rRNA is generated. However, protein genes require additional steps: Nuclear transport: mRNA has to be transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis. Protein synthesis: In the cytoplasm, mRNA binds to ribosomes, which can synthesize a polypeptide based on the sequence of mRNA. The central dogma According to the above process, the flow of genetic information is in the following direction: DNA > RNA > Protein. This rule was dubbed the central dogma, because it was thought that the same principle would apply to all organisms. However, we now know that for RNA viruses, the flow of genetic information starts from RNA.  " ;

Viruses are the smallest organisms, with diameters ranging from 20 nm to 300 nm (1 nm = 10-9 meter). A virus consists of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat called capsid. Some viruses also have an envelope surrounding the capsid. Viruses can be sphere-shaped, or helical. While many bacteria are not harmful to the human body, most viruses do cause disease because they invade living, normal cells. They then multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. Each virus is very particular about which cell it attacks. Various human viruses specifically attack particular cells in the body's organs, systems, or tissues, such as the liver, respiratory system, or blood cells. Although types of viruses behave differently, most survive by taking over the machinery that makes a cell work. Briefly, when a single virus particle (virion), comes in contact with a cell it likes, it may attach to special landing sites on the surface of that cell. From there, the virus may inject molecules into the cell, or the cell may swallow up the virion. Once inside the cell, viral molecules such as DNA or RNA direct the cell to make new virus offspring. That's how a virus infects a cell. Viruses can even infect bacteria. These viruses, called bacteriophages, may help researchers develop alternatives to antibiotic medicines for wiping out bacterial infections. Some viral infections do not result in disease. For example, by the time most people in the United States become adults, they have been infected by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Most of these people, however, do not develop CMV disease symptoms. Other viral infections can result in deadly diseases, such as HIV which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and coronaviruses which cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  " ;

Fertilization between a normal egg and an abnormal diploid sperm. Fertilization between an abnormal diploid egg and a normal sperm. Monosomy The cell has only one copy of a specific chromosome. For example, individuals with Turner's syndrome have a single X chromosome and no Y. Trisomy The cell has an extra copy of a specific chromosome. Examples: Down's syndrome - with three copies of chromosome 21. Klinefelter's syndrome - with three sex chromosomes (XXY). Both monosomy and trisomy arise from the same mechanism as explained in the following figure. Figure 8-E-1. Origins of monosomy and trisomy. (a) During mitotic metaphase or meiotic metaphase II, one pair of sister chromatids does not align at the equatorial plane. Consequently, both sister chromatids move to the same cell. One daughter cell will show trisomy and another daughter cell will have monosomy. (b) During meiotic metaphase I, two homologous pairs of sister chromatids do not align at the equatorial plane and subsequently move to the same cell (a phenomenon called nondisjunction). The resulting daughter cells also have either monosomy or trisomy. Structural abnormality Chromosomal Translocation Chromosomal translocation is the interchange of parts between nonhomologous chromosomes. It is caused by breaks in more than one chromosome, followed by attachment of a chromosome fragment to a different chromosome. There are two main types: reciprocal translocation (Figure 8-E-2) and Robertsonian translocation. Figure 8-E-2. An example of reciprocal translocation. Breaks occur first in both chromosome 4 and chromosome 20. Then one fragment of chromosome 4 attaches to a fragment of chromosome 20 and another fragment of chromosome 4 attaches to another fragment of chromosome 20. Picture courtesy: National Human Genome Research Institute. Robertsonian translocation is caused by breaks at the centromeres of two nonhomologous acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with centromeres near their ends, e.g., chromosome 13, 14, 21, and 22). After the breaks, the long arms of two chromosomes join together to form a single chromosome. The short arms may join to form another chromosome, but it is usually lost within a few cell divisions. Therefore, the karyotype of a person with Robertsonian translocation usually exhibits only 45 chromosomes. In addition to the trisomy 21 mentioned above, the Down's syndrome may also be caused by Robertsonian translocation, in which the long arm of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, usually chromosome 14 or itself. Inversion, Deletion and Ring Structure Two breaks in a single chromosome can cause inversion, deletion or ring structure as shown in the following figure. Figure 8-E-3. Chromosomal abnormality resulting from two breaks in a single chromosome. Inversion: The segment between two breakpoints is inverted before resealing the breaks. Deletion: The breaks reseal without including the segment between breakpoints. Examples: cri-du-chat syndrome and William's syndrome. Ring chromosome: Two ends of the segment between breakpoints are joined to form a circular structure.  " ;

Polypeptides usually refer to long peptides whereas oligopeptides are short peptides (< 10 amino acids). Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides with more than 50 amino acids. Primary structure The primary structure of a protein refers to its amino acid sequence. The amino acid in a peptide is also called a residue. Figure 2-B-1. The amino acid sequence (primary structure) of ribonuclease A (RNase A), which is an enzyme acting on RNA. Each letter represents an amino acid (see one letter code of each amino acid). Peptide bond A peptide bond is the linkage between two amino acids, formed by the condensation reaction, as shown below: Figure 2-B-2. Formation of the peptide bond by condensation reaction. Phi-Psi angles Due to the specific electronic structure of the peptide bond, the atoms on its two ends cannot rotate around the bond. Hence, the atoms of the group, O=C-N-H, are fixed on the same plane, known as the peptide plane. The whole plane may rotate around the N-Cα bond (φ angle) or C-Cα bond (ψ angle). Cα is the carbon atom connected to the R group. Figure 2-B-3. Illustration of the peptide plane (gray area) and φ-ψ angles. The red line formed by the repeating -Cα-C-N-Cα- is the backbone of the peptide chain. Mathematically, phi (φ) and psi (ψ) are the dihedral angle (also known as torsional angle) which is defined as the angle between the point (e.g., Cα) at the end of a 4-point sequence and the plane (e.g., peptide plane) occupied by the other three points. In a peptide, phi-psi angles are restricted to certain ranges. A plot of their distribution is called the Ramachandran plot.  " ;

The capsule is more closely associated with the cell than the slime. Flagella are long, rigid protein rods, facilitating the movement of motile bacteria. Fimbriae and pili are short hair-like structures used to attach other cells. They are essential for infecting other organisms. In bacteria, the cell wall contains a unique structure called peptidoglycan. Archaea do not possess peptidoglycan, but some archaea may contain pseudopeptidoglycan, which is composed of N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid, instead of N-acetylmuramic in peptidoglycan. Because of this structural difference, archaea are resistant to many cell wall antibiotics. Gram Staining Figure 1-A-3. A Gram stain of mixed Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive, in purple) and Escherichia coli (Gram negative, in red). Bacteria may be divided into two groups, on the basis of their cell wall structures and the response to Gram stain: Gram-negative and Gram-positive. In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is composed of three layers: (1) the periplasmic space which is an open area located outside the plasma membrane, (2) a thin layer of peptidoglycan external to the periplasmic space, and (3) the outer membrane surrounding the peptidoglycan. The Gram-positive bacteria do not have the periplasmic space and outer membrane, but have a thicker peptidoglycan layer. As a result, they are quite sensitive to lysozyme and penicillin.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "DNA library is a collection of DNA fragments. It may be divided into two types: The genomic library contains DNA fragments representing the entire genome of an organism. The cDNA library contains only complementary DNA molecules synthesized from mRNA molecules in a cell. Preparation of a DNA Library Figure 9-B-1. Preparation of the genomic library using λ vectors. It is basically the cloning of all DNA fragments representing the entire genome. Genomic Library The genomic library is normally made by λ phage vectors, instead of plasmid vectors, for the following reasons. The entire human genome is about 3 x 109 bp long whereas a plasmid or λ phage vector may carry up to 20 kb fragment. This would require 1.5 x 105 recombinant plasmids or λ phages. When plating E. coli colonies on a 3\" petri dish, the maximum number to allow isolation of individual colonies is about 200 colonies per dish. Thus, at least 700 petri dishes are required to construct a human genomic library. By contrast, as many as 5 x 104 λ phage plagues can be screened on a typical petri dish. This requires only 30 petri dishes to construct a human genomic library. Another advantage of the λ phage vector is that its transformation efficiency is about 1000 times higher than the plasmid vector. cDNA Library The advantage of cDNA library is that it contains only the coding region of a genome. To prepare a cDNA library, the first step is to isolate the total mRNA from the cell type of interest. Because eukaryotic mRNAs consist of a poly-A tail, they can easily be separated. Then the enzyme reverse transcriptase is used to synthesize a DNA strand complementary to each mRNA molecule. After the single-stranded DNA molecules are converted into double-stranded DNA molecules by DNA polymerase, they are inserted into vectors and cloned. Probes A probe is a piece of DNA or RNA used to detect specific nucleic acid sequences by hybridization (binding of two nucleic acid chains by base pairing) . They are radioactively labeled so that the hybridized nucleic acid can be identified by autoradiography. The size of probes ranges from a few nucleotides to hundreds of kilobases. Long probes are usually made by cloning. Originally they may be double-stranded, but the working probes must be single-stranded. Short probes (oligonucleotide probes) can be made by chemical synthesis. They are single-stranded. Suppose we have known the sequence of a specific gene in yeast and want to find its homologous gene in human, then we may use the specific yeast gene as a probe to detect its homologous gene from the human genomic library. On the other hand, if we know the conserved sequence in the specific gene between yeast and human, we may use oligonucleotide probes containing only the conserved sequence. Typically, an oligonucleotide about 20 nucleotides long is sufficient to screen a library. In some cases, we have known the partial sequence of a protein and want to detect its gene in the library. Then we may synthesize oligonucleotide probes based on the known peptide sequence. Since an amino acid may be encoded by several DNA triplets, many different oligonucleotide probes are often needed. Figure 9-B-2. The relationship between a peptide and all possible DNA sequences. In this example, the peptide sequence Leu-Phe-Tyr-Met-His-Asp corresponds to 96 (= 6 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 2) possible DNA sequences. Screening Once a particular DNA fragment is identified, it can be isolated and amplified to determine its sequence. If we know the partial sequence of a gene and want to determine its entire sequence, the probe should contain the known sequence so that the detected DNA fragment may contain the gene of interest. Figure 9-B-3. Screening of a specific DNA fragment. After recombinant λ virions form plaques on the lawn of E. coli, the nitrocellulose filter (membrane) is placed on the surface of the petri dish to pick up λ phages from each plaque. Then, the filter is incubated in an alkaline solution to disrupt the virions and release the encapsulated DNA, which is subsequently denatured. Next, the probe is added to hybridize with the target DNA fragment, whose position may be displayed by autoradiography.  " ;

The hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to one of electronegative atoms, called the hydrogen bond donor. The other electronegative atom is named the hydrogen bond acceptor. The two electronegative atoms may take up some electron density from the hydrogen atom. As a result, each electronegative atom carries partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom carries partial positive charge. The hydrogen atom and the hydrogen bond acceptor can then have attractive interactions. The strength of the hydrogen bond depends on the donor and acceptor as well as their environment. The bond energy usually ranges from 1 kcal/mol to 5 kcal/mol. This energy is smaller than covalent bond energy, but greater than thermal energy (0.6 kcal/mol at room temperature). Therefore, the hydrogen bond can provide a significant stabilizing force in macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. When a hydrogen bond is formed, the distance between the donor and the acceptor is about 0.28 nm (1 nm = 10-9 meter). The hydrogen atom is still covalently bonded to the donor and their distance is shorter than that between the hydrogen atom and the acceptor. Figure 2-C-3. Hydrogen bonds. (a) The general form.

Prepare various types of aminoacyl-tRNA, e.g., Thr-tRNA, Phe-tRNA, Lys-tRNA, etc. Radioactively label an aminoacyl-tRNA (e.g. Phe-tRNA) which might contain the anticodon for the synthesized trinucleotide. Place the trinucleotide, aminoacyl-tRNA and ribosome on a nitrocellulose filter. Individual trinucleotide and aminoacyl-tRNA can pass through the filter, but the ribosome is too big to pass through. Therefore, if the labeled aminoacyl-tRNA contains the anticodon for the trinucleotide, it will bind to the trinucleotide and ribosome on the filter. In this case, the radioactivity can be detected on the filter and the amino acid in the labeled aminoacyl-tRNA is likely to be encoded by the trinucleotide. If no radioactivity was detected, the trinucleotide is unlikely to be the codon of the amino acid. Most of the 64 possible codons can be determined by repeating this procedure for different trinucleotides and labellings.  " ;

It may be located either upstream or downstream of the transcriptional initiation site. However, most of them are located upstream. In prokaryotes, enhancers are quite close to the promoter, but eukaryotic enhancers could be far from the promoter. A few examples are given below. E. coli glnA gene The enhancer of the glnA gene is located about 120 bp from the start site, containing two binding sites for the transcription factor nitrogen regulatory protein C (NTRC). Yeast GAL1 and GAL10 genes Both GAL1 and GAL10 genes are regulated by the same enhancer between them. The two genes are transcribed along opposite directions. Therefore, the enhancer is located upstream of both transcriptional start sites. It is also called upstream activating sequences (UAS), which contains four binding sites of the transcription factor GAL4. Human β globin gene cluster The human β globin gene cluster is controlled by an enhancer region comprising HS1 to HS4, which contain the binding sites of GATA-1, NF-E2, AP-1 and other transcriptional activators. This region is known as the locus control region (LCR), which regulates the expression of all five genes (ε, Gγ, Aγ, δ and β), even though the distance between HS4 and the β gene is as far as 60 kb. In embryonic DNA, the ε gene is preferentially expressed. In fetal DNA, Gγ and Aγ are much more strongly expressed than the other genes. In adult DNA, expression is switched to mainly the β gene, while the δ gene is weakly expressed.   Table 4-C-3. Examples of transcriptional activators in mammals.

At the extreme end of a chromosome, there is no way to synthesize this region when the last primer is removed. Therefore, the lagging strand is always shorter than its template by at least the length of the primer. This is the so-called \"end-replication problem\". Bacteria do not have the end-replication problem, because its DNA is circular. In eukaryotes, the chromosome ends are called telomeres which have at least two functions: to protect chromosomes from fusing with each other. to solve the end-replication problem. The procedure to solve the end-replication problem is outlined in Figure 7-C-1. Mechanism of the telomere extension by telomerase is explained in Figure 7-C-2. Figure 7-C-1. Telomerase and telomere extension. To extend the length of a telomere, the telomerase first extends its longer strand. Then, using the same mechanism as synthesizing the lagging strand, the shorter strand is extended. Figure 7-C-2. The mechanism of telomere extension by telomerase. In a human chromosome, the telomere is about 10 to 15 kb in length, composed of the tandem repeat sequence: TTAGGG. The telomerase contains an essential RNA component which is complementary to the telomere repeat sequence. Hence, the internal RNA can serve as the template for synthesizing DNA. Through telomerase translocation, a telomere may be extended by many repeats. Aging In the absence of telomerase, the telomere will become shorter after each cell division. When it reaches a certain length, the cell may cease to divide and die. Therefore, telomerase plays a critical role in the aging process.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "A molecule, or an atom group in a molecule, may lose or gain a proton when the molecule is placed in an aqueous solution. The exact probability that a molecule will be protonated or deprotonated depends on the pKa of the molecule and the pH of the solution. Let AH be an atom group in a molecule. AH may be neutral or charged. After AH loses a proton, it is denoted by A-. The protonation/deprotonation reaction may be written as From the last equation, we can see that half of molecules will lose protons if they are in a solution with pH = pKa. The higher the pH value, the more likely a molecule will lose a proton. On the other hand, from the definition of pH, we find that the proton concentration of a solution becomes lower at higher pH, thereby capable of accepting more protons. This physical concept is consistent with the result we just obtained from the equation. Figure 2-A-4. pKa values of amino group, carboxyl group and a few R groups. This information tells us that in a neutral solution: The carboxyl group is most likely negatively charged. The amino group is most likely positively charged The R group of aspartate and glutamate are most likely negatively charged. The R group of lysine and arginine are most likely positively charged. The R group of tyrosine at pH = 7 is most likely neutral. The R group of histidine has 10% probability to become positively charged at pH = 7, but the probability increases to 50% at pH = 6. Thus, histidine is very sensitive to pH change in the physiological range. Figure 2-A-5. pKa values of phosphate groups. This information tells us that in a neutral solution H3PO4 is very likely to lose a proton and become H2PO4-. The latter has a 50% chance of losing another proton, becoming HPO42-. The chance for HPO42- to lose an additional proton is very small. Hence, the average charge of a phosphate group is about 1.5 electron charges.  " ;

Therefore, in most cases, histone acetylation enhances transcription while histone deacetylation represses transcription. Figure 4-G-1. Acetylation and deacetylation of the lysine residue. Histone acetylation is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylation is catalyzed by histone deacetylases (denoted by HDs or HDACs). Several different forms of HATs and HDs have been identified. Among them, CBP/p300 is probably the most important, since it can interact with numerous transcription regulators. DNA Methylation DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group (CH3) to the DNA's cytosine base. It may affect gene transcription through several different mechanisms (Illustration). The methylation pattern is heritable after cell division (Illustration). Therefore, DNA methylation plays an important role in cell differentiation during development.

The resulting RNA transcript will form a stem-loop structure to terminate transcription. Figure 4-D-2.

Rho-dependent mechanism Rho is a ~ 50 kD protein, involved in bout half of E. coli transcriptional terminations. It has been well established that six Rho proteins form a hexamer to terminate transcription, but the precise mechanism is not clear. Experiments suggest that two components are essential: (i) the upstream Rho loading site and (ii) the downstream termination site. The Rho hexamer first binds to the RNA transcript at the upstream site which is 70-80 nucleotides long and rich in C residues. Upon binding, the Rho hexamer moves along the RNA in the 3' direction. If movement of the polymerase is slow, the Rho hexamer will catch up and terminate the transcription at the downstream termination site.

        txtmod:sectionText     "Initiation Peptide synthesis always starts from methionine (Met). Therefore, the initial aminoacyl-tRNA is Met-tRNAiMet, where the subscript \"i\" specifies \"initiation\". In bacteria, the methionine of the initial aminoacyl-tRNA has been modified by the addition of a formyl group (HCO) to its amino group. The modified methionine is called formylmethionine (fMet), which is unique for bacteria. Thus, fMet is an obvious foreign substance in eukaryotes. It can elicit a strong immune response. In humans, the immune response elicited by the peptide \"fMet-Leu-Phe\" is about a thousand times greater than \"Met-Leu-Phe\". Elongation A ribosome contains two major tRNA-binding sites: A site and P site. After the large subunit joins the initiation complex, the initial Met-tRNAiMet enters the P site and the newly arrived aminoacyl-tRNA is always placed at the A site (\"A\" for \"aminoacyl\"). Then, methionine is transferred to the new aminoacyl-tRNA, forming a \"peptidyl-tRNA\" where a peptide is attached to the tRNA. Subsequently, the empty tRNA at the P site is ejected from the ribosome and the peptidyl-tRNA jumps to the P site (\"P\" for \"peptidyl\"). During this translocation step, the ribosome also moves one codon down the mRNA chain. Similar steps are repeated in the next cycles of elongation. Termination Protein synthesis will terminate when the ribosome arrives at one of three stop codons. The termination process is assisted by special proteins called termination factors which recognize the stop codons. Their association stimulates the release of the peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome. Subsequently, the released peptidyl-tRNA divides into tRNA and a newly synthesized peptide chain. The ribosome also divides into the large and small subunits, ready for synthesizing another peptide. Figure 5-C-6. The steps involved in protein synthesis. (a) In the absence of mRNA, the large and small subunits of a ribosome are separated. At the beginning of peptide synthesis, initiation factors (IF) first assist the assembly of the small subunit, mRNA and the initial aminoacyl-tRNA. Then, the large subunit is recruited to join the complex. (b) In the elongation process, one cycle involves the following steps: (i) New entry. A new aminoacyl-tRNA with a correct anticodon is brought to the A site. This step is catalyzed by elongation factors Tu and Ts in prokaryotes, and by elongation factors EF1 and EF1β in eukaryotes. (ii) Peptide synthesis. The peptide attached to the peptidyl-tRNA at the P site is transferred to the new aminoacyl-tRNA at the A site, generating a peptidyl-tRNA with a longer peptide. This step is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase. (iii) Translocation. The empty tRNA at the P site is ejected from the ribosome and the peptidyl-tRNA generated at the A site takes over the vacant P site. In the mean time, the ribosome moves one codon down the mRNA chain. The A to P switch is catalyzed by the elongation factor G in bacteria, and by the elongation factor EF2 in eukaryotes.  " ;

It is also called the CpG island, where \"p\" simply indicates that \"C\" and \"G\" are connected by a phosphodiester bond. CpG islands are often located around the promoters of housekeeping genes (which are essential for general cell functions) or other genes frequently expressed in a cell. At these locations, the CG sequence is not methylated. By contrast, the CG sequences in inactive genes are usually methylated to suppress their expression. The methylated cytosine may be converted to thymine by accidental deamination. Unlike the cytosine to uracil mutation which is efficiently repaired, the cytosine to thymine mutation can be corrected only by the mismatch repair which is very inefficient. Hence, over evolutionary time scales, the methylated CG sequence will be converted to the TG sequence. This explains the deficiency of the CG sequence in inactive genes. Inheritance of DNA methylation pattern Any type of cells have their own methylation pattern so that a unique set of proteins may be expressed to perform functions specific for this cell type. Thus, during cell division, the methylation pattern should also pass over to the daughter cell. This is achieved by the enzyme, DNA methyltransferase, which can methylate only the CG sequence paired with methylated CG. Figure 7-F-2. Inheritance of the DNA methylation pattern. The DNA methyltransferase can methylate only the CG sequence paired with methylated CG. The CG sequence not paired with methylated CG will not be methylated. Hence, the original pattern can be maintained after DNA replication.  " ;

This is made possible by the specific signal sequence in the newly synthesized peptide. Figure 5-D-1. Protein sorting.

It turns out that three nucleotides (a codon) code for one amino acid, as shown in the following figure. Figure 3-E-1. The standard genetic code. Synthesis of a peptide always starts from methionine (Met), coded by AUG. The stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) signals the end of a peptide. This table applies to mRNA sequences. For DNA, U (uracil) should be replaced by T (thymine).

        txtmod:sectionText     "Genes and Cancer Chemicals (e.g., from smoking), radiation, viruses, and heredity all contribute to the development of cancer by triggering changes in a cell's genes. Chemicals and radiation act by damaging genes, viruses introduce their own genes into cells, and heredity passes on alterations in genes that make a person more susceptible to cancer. Genes are inherited instructions that reside within a person's chromosomes. Each gene instructs a cell how to build a specific product--in most cases, a particular kind of protein. Genes are altered, or \"mutated,\" in various ways as part of the mechanism by which cancer arises. Oncogenes One group of genes implicated in the development of cancer are damaged genes, called \"oncogenes.\" Oncogenes are genes whose PRESENCE in certain forms and/or overactivity can stimulate the development of cancer. When oncogenes arise in normal cells, they can contribute to the development of cancer by instructing cells to make proteins that stimulate excessive cell growth and division. Proto-Oncogenes and Normal Cell Growth Oncogenes are related to normal genes called proto-oncogenes that encode components of the cell's normal growth-control pathway. Some of these components are growth factors, receptors, signaling enzymes, and transcription factors. Growth factors bind to receptors on the cell surface, which activate signaling enzymes inside the cell that, in turn, activate special proteins called transcription factors inside the cell's nucleus. The activated transcription factors \"turn on\" the genes required for cell growth and proliferation. Oncogenes are Mutant Forms of Proto-Oncogenes Oncogenes arise from the mutation of proto-oncogenes. They resemble proto-oncogenes in that they code for the production of proteins involved in growth control. However, oncogenes code for an altered version (or excessive quantities) of these growth-control proteins, thereby disrupting a cell's growth-signaling pathway. By producing abnormal versions or quantities of cellular growth-control proteins, oncogenes cause a cell's growth-signaling pathway to become hyperactive. To use a simple metaphor, the growth-control pathway is like the gas pedal of an automobile. The more active the pathway, the faster cells grow and divide. The presence of an oncogene is like having a gas pedal that is stuck to the floorboard, causing the cell to continually grow and divide. A cancer cell may contain one or more oncogenes, which means that one or more components in this pathway will be abnormal. Tumor Suppressor Genes A second group of genes implicated in cancer are the \"tumor suppressor genes.\" Tumor suppressor genes are normal genes whose ABSENCE can lead to cancer. In other words, if a pair of tumor suppressor genes are either lost from a cell or inactivated by mutation, their functional absence might allow cancer to develop. Individuals who inherit an increased risk of developing cancer often are born with one defective copy of a tumor suppressor gene. Because genes come in pairs (one inherited from each parent), an inherited defect in one copy will not lead to cancer because the other normal copy is still functional. But if the second copy undergoes mutation, the person then may develop cancer because there no longer is any functional copy of the gene. Tumor Suppressor Genes Act Like a Brake Pedal Tumor suppressor genes are a family of normal genes that instruct cells to produce proteins that restrain cell growth and division. Since tumor suppressor genes code for proteins that slow down cell growth and division, the loss of such proteins allows a cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled fashion. Tumor suppressor genes are like the brake pedal of an automobile. The loss of a tumor suppressor gene function is like having a brake pedal that does not function properly, thereby allowing the cell to grow and divide continually. p53 Tumor Suppressor Protein Triggers Cell Suicide One particular tumor suppressor gene codes for a protein called \"p53\" that can trigger cell suicide (apoptosis). In cells that have undergone DNA damage, the p53 protein acts like a brake pedal to halt cell growth and division. If the damage cannot be repaired, the p53 protein eventually initiates cell suicide, thereby preventing the genetically damaged cell from growing out of control.   [This page was adapted from National Cancer Institute.]  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "Transcription is a process in which one DNA strand is used as template to synthesize a complementary RNA. The following is an example: Note that uracil (U) of RNA is paired with adenine (A) of DNA. There are a few different names for these nucleic acid strands. The DNA strand which serves as the template may be called \"template strand\", \"minus strand\", or \"antisense strand\". The other DNA strand may be termed \"non-template strand\", \"coding strand\", \"plus strand\", or \"sense strand\". Since both DNA coding strand and RNA strand are complementary to the template strand, they have the same sequences except that T in the DNA coding strand is replaced by U in the RNA strand. Figure 4-B-1. Schematic illustration of transcription. (a) DNA before transcription. (b) During transcription, the DNA should unwind so that one of its strand can be used as template to synthesize a complementary RNA. Growth of a nucleic acid strand is always in the 5' to 3' direction. This is true not only for the synthesis of RNA during transcription, but also for the synthesis of DNA during replication. The enzymes, called polymerases, are used to catalyze the synthesis of nucleic acid strands. RNA strands are synthesized by RNA polymerases. DNA strands are synthesized by DNA polymerases. The entire transcription process should involve the following essential steps: (i) Binding of polymerases to the initiation site. The DNA sequence which signals the initiation of transcription is called the promoter. Prokaryotic polymerases can recognize the promoter and bind to it directly, but eukaryotic polymerases have to rely on other proteins called transcription factors. (ii) Unwinding (melting) of the DNA double helix (Figure 4-B-1). The enzyme which can unwind the double helix is called helicase. Prokaryotic polymerases have the helicase activity, but eukaryotic polymerases do not. Unwinding of eukaryotic DNA is carried out by a specific transcription factor. (iii) Synthesis of RNA based on the sequence of the DNA template strand. RNA polymerases use nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to construct a RNA strand. (iv) Termination of synthesis. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes use different signals to terminate transcription. [Note: the stop codon in the genetic code is a signal for the end of peptide synthesis, not the end of transcription.] Transcription in eukaryotes is much more complicated than in prokaryotes, partly because eukaryotic DNA is associated with histones, which could hinder the access of polymerases to the promotor.  " ;

It may occur by one of two mechanisms: (1) directly as DNA, (2) through RNA. The mobile elements that transpose through DNA are called transposons and those via RNA are referred to as retrotransposons. Some examples are given in the following figure. Figure 8-D-8. Classification of mobile elements. Mechanisms of transpositional recombination Figure 8-D-9. Mechanisms of transpositional recombination. (a) For transposons. The transposon in donor DNA is cut by a special enzyme and then inserted into a target DNA. In bacteria, this enzyme is called transposase which has both nuclease and ligase activities. (b) For retrotransposons. The retrotransposon in donor DNA is first transcribed into RNA and then reverse-transcribed into DNA, which is inserted into a target DNA by the same recombination mechanism as the DNA intermediates of transposons. The transpositional recombination as shown above involves DNA recombination whose mechanism is explained in the following figure. Figure 8-D-10. Mechanism of DNA recombination in transposition. In bacteria, the target DNA is cut by transposase, producing sticky ends (single strands, easy to pair with complementary sequences). The transposase also has ligase activity which may ligate the intermediate DNA of transposons. The gaps at sticky ends are filled by DNA polymerase, generating direct repeats. Other organisms are expected to use the same mechanism to insert the DNA intermediates of either transposons or retrotransposons into target DNA. The direct repeats generated by this mechanism is found in ALL mobile elements. In recombinant DNA technology, a DNA fragment is inserted into a target DNA by a slightly different mechanism, which is explained in Chapter 9.  " ;

During the metaphase of cell division, the chromatin condenses and becomes visible as chromosomes. At this time, each chromosome has been duplicated. A chromosome becomes two sister chromatids attached at the centromere. Figure 1-C-2. Schematic drawing of chromosomes. (a) During the metaphase of cell division, a chromosome becomes two sister chromatids attached at the centromere. (b) Notations about the chromosome bands. This figure uses human chromosome 17 as an example. Chromosome banding To see chromosomes by microscope, they are normally treated with chemical dyes, such as Giemsa. The chromosome will appear as a series of alternate dark and light bands. If Giemsa is used, the dark band is called G-band or G-positive band, and the light band is named G-negative band. Similar banding patterns can be observed by using another dye, Quinacrine. However, if chromosomes were treated in a hot alkaline solution before staining with Giemsa, a reverse pattern will be observed, namely, the original dark band will become light band, and vice versa. For this reason, the G-negative band is also known as the R-band. Chromosome bands are named as follows. Each chromosome consists of two arms separated by the centromere. The long arm and short arm are labeled q (for queue) and p (for petit), respectively. At the lowest resolution, only a few major bands can be distinguished, which are labeled q1, q2, q3; p1, p2, p3, etc., counting from the centromere. Higher resolution reveals sub-bands, labeled q11, q12, q13, etc. Sub-sub-bands identified by even higher resolution are labeled q11.1, q11.2, q11.3, etc. Traditionally, the short arm (p) is displayed on top of the long arm (q). See Figure 1-C-5 for the banding pattern of the entire human chromosomes. Karyotype Karyotype is the representation of entire metaphase chromosomes in a cell, arranged in order of size. Figure 1-C-3. The karyotype of human somatic cells. A human somatic cell contains two sets of homologous chromosomes, which may be divided into two types: autosomes and sex chromosomes. Autosomes are further divided into seven groups: A to G. During the metaphase of cell division, each chromosome has been duplicated. Therefore, this karyotype consists of 92 chromosomes.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "Based on catalyzed reactions, the nomenclature committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) recommended the following classification. 1. Oxidoreductases catalyze a variety of oxidation-reduction reactions. Common names include dehydrogenase, oxidase, reductase and catalase. 2. Transferases catalyze transfers of groups (acetyl, methyl, phosphate, etc.). Common names include acetyltransferase, methylase, protein kinase and polymerase. The first three subclasses play major roles in the regulation of cellular processes. Their chemical reactions are shown in Figure 2-E-1. The polymerase is essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. 3. Hydrolases catalyze hydrolysis reactions where a molecule is split into two or more smaller molecules by the addition of water. Common examples are given below. Proteases splits protein molecules. Examples: HIV protease and caspase. HIV protease is essential for HIV replication. Caspase plays a major role in apoptosis. Nucleases splits nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Based on the substrate type, they are divided into RNase and DNase. RNase catalyzes the hydrolysis of RNA and DNase acts on DNA. They may also be divided into exonuclease and endonuclease. The exonuclease progressively splits off single nucleotides from one end of DNA or RNA. The endonuclease splits DNA or RNA at internal sites. Phosphatase catalyzes dephosphorylation (removal of phosphate groups). Example: calcineurin. The immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and Cyclosporin A are the inhibitors of calcineurin. 4. Lyases catalyze the cleavage of C-C, C-O, C-S and C-N bonds by means other than hydrolysis or oxidation. Common names include decarboxylase and aldolase. 5. Isomerases catalyze atomic rearrangements within a molecule. Examples include rotamase, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), epimerase and racemase. 6. Ligases catalyze the reaction which joins two molecules. Examples include peptide synthase, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, DNA ligase and RNA ligase. The IUBMB committee also defines subclasses and sub-subclasses. Each enzyme is assigned an EC (Enzyme Commission) number. For example, the EC number of catalase is EC1.11.1.6. The first digit indicates that the enzyme belongs to oxidoreductase (class 1). Subsequent digits represent subclasses and sub-subclasses. Figure 2-E-1. Three major regulatory chemical reactions. (a) Acetylation - addition of an acetyl group to lysine's R group by acetyltransferase. (b) Methylation - addition of a methyl group to DNA's base (e.g. cytosine) by methylase. (c) Phosphorylation - addition of a phosphate group to the R group of tyrosine, serine or threonine (only tyrosine is shown here) by protein kinase. Figure 2-E-2. The role of rotamase and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The reactions catalyzed by the two enzymes can assist a peptide chain to fold into a correct three-dimensional structure.  " ;

The name \"satellites\" comes from their optical spectra. Figure 3-G-1. Illustration of satellite bands. By using buoyant density gradient centrifugation, DNA fragments with significantly different base compositions may be separated, and then monitored by the absorption spectra of ultraviolet light. The main band represents the bulk DNA, and the \"satellite\" bands originate from tandem repeats. Satellites The size of a satellite DNA ranges from 100 kb to over 1 Mb. In humans, a well known example is the alphoid DNA located at the centromere of all chromosomes. Its repeat unit is 171 bp and the repetitive region accounts for 3-5% of the DNA in each chromosome. Other satellites have a shorter repeat unit. Most satellites in humans or in other organisms are located at the centromere. Minisatellites The size of a minisatellite ranges from 1 kb to 20 kb. One type of minisatellites is called variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). Its repeat unit ranges from 9 bp to 80 bp. They are located in non-coding regions. The number of repeats for a given minisatellite may differ between individuals. This feature is the basis of DNA fingerprinting. Another type of minisatellites is the telomere. In a human germ cell, the size of a telomere is about 15 kb. In an aging somatic cell, the telomere is shorter. The telomere contains tandemly repeated sequence GGGTTA. Microsatellites Microsatellites are also known as short tandem repeats (STR), because a repeat unit consists of only 1 to 6 bp and the whole repetitive region spans less than 150 bp. Similar to minisatellites, the number of repeats for a given microsatellite may differ between individuals. Therefore, microsatellites can also be used for DNA fingerprinting. In addition, both microsatellite and minisatellite patterns can provide information about paternity. The most famous case is President Thomas Jefferson and His Alleged Sons The term \"polymorphism\" describes the existence of different forms within a population, e.g., difference in the number of tandem repeats. All tandem repeat polymorphisms could result from DNA recombination during meiosis (Chapter 8 Section D). The microsatellite polymorphism could also be caused by replication slippage.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "RNA splicing is a process that removes introns and joins exons in a primary transcript. An intron usually contains a clear signal for splicing (e.g., the beta globin gene). In some cases (e.g., the Tau gene), a splicing signal may be masked by a regulatory protein, resulting in alternative splicing. In rare cases (e.g., HIV genes), a pre-mRNA may contain several ambiguous splicing signals, resulting in a few alternatively spliced mRNAs. Splicing signal Most introns start from the sequence GU and end with the sequence AG (in the 5' to 3' direction). They are referred to as the splice donor and splice acceptor site, respectively. However, the sequences at the two sites are not sufficient to signal the presence of an intron. Another important sequence is called the branch site located 20 - 50 bases upstream of the acceptor site. The consensus sequence of the branch site is \"CU(A/G)A(C/U)\", where A is conserved in all genes. In over 60% of cases, the exon sequence is (A/C)AG at the donor site, and G at the acceptor site. Figure 5-A-4. The consensus sequence for splicing. Pu = A or G; Py = C or U. Splicing mechanism The detailed splicing mechanism is quite complex. In short, it involves five snRNAs and their associated proteins. These ribonucleoproteins form a large (60S) complex, called spliceosome. Then, after a two-step enzymatic reaction, the intron is removed and two neighboring exons are joined together (see Alberts et al.). The branch point A residue plays a critical role in the enzymatic reaction. Figure 5-A-5. Schematic drawing for the formation of the spliceosome during RNA splicing. U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 denote snRNAs and their associated proteins. The U3 snRNA is not involved in the RNA splicing, but is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA. β-globin gene Expression of the β-globin gene is a typical process. This gene contains two introns and three exons. Interestingly, the codon of the 30th amino acid, AGG, is separated by an intron. As a result, the first two nucleotides AG are in one exon and the third nucleotide G is in another exon. Figure 5-A-6. Expression of the human β-globin gene. U5 and U3 represent untranslated regions at the 5' and 3' end, respectively. Note that the mature β-globin protein does not contain the initiating methionine for protein synthesis. Tau gene MAPT The Tau protein has six isoforms produced from a single gene through alternative RNA splicing (Figure 5-A-7). They differ in the number of inserts at the N-terminal half and the number of repeats at the C-terminal half . The number of inserts may be 0, 1 or 2, depending on whether the exon 2 and/or 3 are included during RNA splicing. The number of repeats may be either 3 or 4. The 4-repeat (4R) Tau includes the second repeat encoded by exon 10. The repeat region is the microtubule binding domain. The 4R Tau binds to, assembles, and stabilizes microtubules more effectively than 3R Tau. In a healthy adult brain, the levels of 4R and 3R Tau proteins are approximately equal. Distortion of the balance will lead to neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease. The underlying mechanism is explained in this book. Figure 5-A-7. The gene, mRNA and protein isoforms of Tau. In Tau genomic structure (top panel), the black boxes represent constitutive exons, and the gray and empty boxes represent alternative spliced exons. The middle panel demonstrates mRNAs of Tau in adult human brain. Six mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10, which is indicated by alternative lines linking these exons. The lower panel shows six isoforms of Tau in adult human brain. Gray boxes represent the N-terminal inserts (coded by exons 2 and 3) or repeats (coded by exons 9, 10, 11 and 12). The second repeat coded by exon 10 is highlighted by dark box. An isoform is commonly designated as xNyR, where x is the number of inserts and y is the number of repeats. [Source: Liu and Gong, 2008] HIV-1 genome The HIV-1 genome contains nine genes: gag, pol, vif, vpr, vpu, env, nef, rev and tat. Their protein products are all derived from a single primary transcript. This is achieved by three mechanisms: (i) alternative splicing, (ii) leaky scanning of the initiation codon, and (iii) ribosomal frameshifting. Figure 5-A-8. Alternative splicing of the HIV-1 primary transcript. (i) is unspliced, (ii) to (iv) are singly spliced, (v) and (vi) are doubly spliced. The resulting mRNA (i), (iv) and (vi) are bicistronic. The star \"*\" indicates the location of the initiation codon (AUG). The HIV genome contains several ambiguous splicing signals, resulting in a few alternatively spliced mRNAs. They can be divided into three groups: (I) unspliced, (II) singly spliced, and (III) doubly spliced. As shown in the above figure, the resulting mRNA (i), (iv) and (vi) are bicistronic (each encoding two proteins). mRNA (i) encodes gag and pol proteins, mRNA (iv) encodes vpu and env, mRNA (vi) encodes rev and nef. Protein synthesis starts from the initiation codon (AUG) and ends with one of three stop codons. In HIV, mRNA (iv) and (vi) have two initiation codons, but the first is sometimes skipped so that the second protein may be synthesized. mRNA (i) has only one initiation codon. Synthesis of the second protein (pol) is due to translational frameshifting.  " ;

If Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis is used, the upper limit can be extended to 10 Mb. Polyacrylamide gels may separate nucleic acids that differ in length by only 1 nucleotide if their length is less than 500 bp. Figure 9-C-1. Gel electrophoresis. In a gel (either agarose or polyacrylamide), the negatively charged DNA fragments move toward the positive electrode at a rate inversely proportional to their length. After the electric field is applied for a certain period of time, DNA fragments with different lengths will be separated, which can be visualized by autoradiography or by treatment with a fluorescent dye (e.g., ethidium bromide). The relationship between the size of a DNA fragment and the distance it migrates in the gel is logarithmic. Therefore, from the band positions, the lengths of DNA fragments can be determined.  " ;

Hydrogen bonds play a role in stabilizing the α helix conformation. However, the size and charges of sidechains are also important factors. Alanine has a greater propensity to form α helices than proline. An α helix can be either right-handed or left-handed, as defined in the following figure. Figure 2-C-4. α helix conformations.

The right-handed or left-handed helix may be distinguished by stretching out your thumb and curling the other four fingers. Imaging that in the above figure the helix is spiraling upward. Stretch your right thumb upward, then the other four fingers of the right hand will be able to curl in the same direction as each turn in the spiral. The same result can be obtained if you imagine that the helix is spiraling downward and point your thumb downward. The left hand works for the left-handed α helix.

        txtmod:sectionText     "Genome mapping is the process of finding the location of genes on each chromosome. It is a critical step in identifying the genes involved in a genetic disease. Once a disease gene is accurately located, we can determine its DNA sequence and study its protein product. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited disease in the United States. As many as 1 in 2500 Americans of Northern European descent carry a gene with CF. In 1985, the gene was mapped to chromosome 7q31-q32 by linkage analysis. Four years later, its DNA sequence was determined by Francis Collins and colleagues. We now know that the disease is caused by the defect of a chloride channel encoded by the CFTR gene. There are two types of genome mapping: Genetic Mapping uses linkage analysis to determine the relative position between two genes on a chromosome. Physical Mapping uses all available techniques or information to determine the absolute position of a gene on a chromosome. Linkage Analysis The genetic mapping is based on the linkage between \"loci\" (locations of genes). If two loci are usually inherited together, they are said to be \"linked\". The linkage of two loci depends on their recombination frequency during meiosis, as explained below. A locus (singular of loci) may have different sequences, referred to as alleles. Consider two loci A and B, each having two alleles (one from mother, another from father). A1 and A2 are the two alleles of locus A ; B1 and B2 are the two alleles of locus B. Initially, A1 and B1 are located on the same chromosome. A2 and B2 are located on a different chromosome. Figure 10-A-1. Illustration of recombination between two loci A and B. (a) Two pairs of sister chromatids align during meiosis. A1 and B1 are located on the same chromosome. A2 and B2 are located on a different chromosome. (b) DNA crossover leads to recombination if the chiasma is located between the two loci. (c) DNA crossover does not lead to recombination if the chiasma is not located between the two loci. The DNA crossover may cause recombination of loci A and B. Namely, A1 and B2 (or A2 and B1) are located on the same chromosome. The recombination frequency depends on the distance between the two loci and the position of crossover (the chiasma). The closer they are, the less likely the recombination will occur, because recombination occurs only when the chiasma is located between the two loci. Although linkage analysis has been quite successful in identifying single-gene diseases, it has not fared as well for diseases resulting from mutations in multiple genes throughout the genome. To study such diseases, a more powerful method has been developed, which is discussed in the next section.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "There is a major difference between DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase: the RNA polymerase can synthesize a new strand whereas the DNA polymerase can only extend an existing strand. Therefore, to synthesize a DNA molecule, a short RNA molecule (~ 5 - 12 nucleotides) must be synthesize first by a special enzyme. The initiating RNA molecule is known as a primer, and the enzyme is called primase. In addition to DNA polymerase and primase, DNA replication requires helicase and single strand binding protein (SSB protein). The role of helicase is to unwind the duplex DNA. SSB proteins can bind to both separated strands, preventing them from annealing (reconstitution of double-stranded DNA from single strands). The replication mechanisms in both bacteria and eukaryotes are similar. However, eukaryotic DNA polymerases do not contain a subunit similar to the E. coli β subunit. They use a separate protein called proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to clamp the DNA. Figure 7-B-2. Structure of PCNA which is formed by three identical subunits. PDB ID = 1AXC. DNA polymerases can extend nucleic acid strands only in the 5' to 3' direction. However, in the direction of a growing fork, only one strand is from 5' to 3'. This strand (the leading strand) can be synthesized continuously. The other strand (the lagging strand), whose 5' to 3' direction is opposite to the movement of a growing fork, should be synthesized discontinuously. Figure 7-B-3. Steps in the synthesis of the lagging strand. (a) Comparison between the leading strand and the lagging strand. (b) The primase first synthesizes a new primer which is about 10 nucleotides in length. The distance between two primers is about 1000-2000 nucleotides in bacteria, and about 100-200 nucleotides in eukaryotic cells. (c) DNA polymerase elongates the new primer in the 5' to 3' direction until it reaches the 5' end of a neighboring primer. The newly synthesized DNA is called an Okazaki fragment. (d) In E. coli, DNA polymerase I has the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity, which is used to remove a primer. (e) DNA ligase joins adjacent Okazaki fragments.

The major role of topoisomerases is to prevent DNA tangling. Figure 7-D-1. Structure of the Topo I/DNA complex. PDB ID = 1A36. Figure 7-D-2. The structure of supercoils. (a) Positive supercoils - the front segment of a DNA molecule cross over the back segment from left to right. (b) Negative supercoils. (c) The positive supercoil in bacteria during DNA replication. There are two types of topoisomerases: type I produces transient single-strand breaks in DNA and types II produces transient double-strand breaks. As a result, the type I enzyme removes supercoils from DNA one at a time, whereas the type II enzyme removes supercoils two at a time. Although the type II topoisomerase is more efficient in removing supercoils, this enzyme requires the energy from ATP hydrolysis, but the type I topoisomerase does not. The topo I of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the type I topoisomerase. The eukaryotic topo II, bacterial gyrase, and bacterial topo IV belong to the type II. In eukaryotes, the topo I and topo II can remove both positive and negative supercoils. In bacteria, the topo I can remove only negative supercoils. The bacterial topo II is also called the gyrase, which has two functions: (1) to remove the positive supercoils during DNA replication, (2) to introduce negative supercoils (one supercoil for 15-20 turns of the DNA helix) so that the DNA molecule can be packed into the cell. During replication, these negative supercoils are removed by topo I. The bacterial topo IV belongs to the type II topoisomerase. This enzyme is involved in decatenation. Figure 7-D-3. The function of topo II: (a) To remove supercoils. This involves a double-strand break (indicated by a short line), allowing the tangled segment to pass through. The break is then resealed. (b) To remove catenanes. The topo II makes a double-strand break in one DNA molecule (the blue one), allowing the other molecule to pass through. The break is then resealed. Without topoisomerases, the DNA cannot replicate normally. Therefore, the inhibitors of topoisomerases have been used as anti-cancer drugs to stop the proliferation of malignant cells. However, these inhibitors may also stop the division of normal cells. Some cells (e.g., hair cells) which need to continuously divide will be most affected. This explains a noticeable side effect: the hair loss.  " ;

Even plant cells and animal cells share significant similarity in the overall organization. Figure 1-A-1. Comparison between a nerve cell and a red blood cell. Classification of cells and organisms All cells are divided into two categories: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells: The prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus. The eukaryotic cell contains a nucleus. Eukaryotes are the organisms made up of eukaryotic cells. They include protista, fungi, animals and plants. Prokaryotes are single-cell organisms including bacteria and archaea. Archaea lives in extreme environments. Methanogens live in anaerobic environment such as swamps. They produce methane and cannot tolerate exposure to oxygen. Extreme halophiles live in very high concentrations of salt (NaCl), e.g., the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake. Extreme thermophiles live in hot, sulfur rich and low pH environment, such as hot springs, geysers and fumaroles in the Yellowstone National Park. Basic cellular components All cells share four common components: Plasma membrane is the cell membrane separating the cell's interior from its surrounding environment. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer, proteins and carbohydrates. The phospholipid bilayer is also the basic component of other biomembranes. Cytoplasm includes all components inside the plasma membrane excluding the nucleus. The word cytosol refers to the cytoplasm excluding all organelles (the membrane-bound structures inside the cell). DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the genetic material. An eukaryotic cell contains several DNA molecules, located in the nucleus and mitochondria which are membrane-bound organelles. A prokaryotic cell contains a single DNA molecule, which has no specific boundary with the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are the sites of synthesize proteins.  " ;

(c) The two homologs exchange the DNA segment from the chiasma to the end of chromosomes. The mechanism of DNA crossover was first explained by Robin Holliday in 1964 (More Info). Due to significant sequence homology, the repetitive sequence region of a chromatid may not line up exactly with its corresponding region in a homologous chromatid or identical sister chromatid. This may result in unequal crossover, which is thought to be the major mechanism underlying VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats). DNA crossover is not the same as gene conversion.  " ;

It consists of four phases: G1, S, G2 and M, where \"G\" stands for \"gap\", \"S\" represents \"synthesis\" and \"M\" means \"mitosis\". A newly divided cell may either enter into another round of cell division or remain in the resting state for a long period of time. In the latter case, the cell is said to be in the G0 phase. Upon specific stimulation, cells in the G0 phase may re-enter the G1 phase. Figure 8-A-1. The cell cycle. Without counting the G0 phase, a cell cycle takes 12-24 hours for most mammalian cells, and only 20-30 minutes for E. coli cells. CDK and Cyclins The progression of a cell cycle is catalyzed by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) which, as the name suggests, is activated by a special class of proteins called cyclins. In mammals, different cyclins are designated as A, B, C, D and so on. In budding yeast (S. cerevisiae), nine cyclins have been identified: Cln1 to Cln3 and Clb1 to Clb6. The proteins of the CDK superfamily in mammals is denoted by Cdk followed by a number. However, in yeast, they are denoted by Cdc (cell division control) and a number. Among them, Cdc2 was first identified in fission yeast ( S. pombe). It is equivalent to Cdc28 in budding yeast, and to Cdk1 in mammals. Cdk1 is often referred to as Cdc2. Figure 8-A-2. Structure of the Cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. PDB ID = 1FIN. Figure 8-A-3. The cyclin-CDK complexes involved in each phase of the cell cycle. The red line indicates the time a particular complex is involved. In budding yeast, the cell cycle is initiated by the binding of Cln1 or Cln2 to Cdc28. Then, Clb5 or Clb6 binds to Cdc28, and pushes the cycle forward. Clb1 and Clb2 are involved in the final phase. In mammals, the cell cycle is initiated by the binding of Cyclin D (CycD) to Cdk4 or Cdk6. The final phase is catalyzed by the binding between Cyclin B (CycB) and Cdk1. The CycB-Cdk1 complex is known as MPF, which originally stands for maturation promoting factor, but now also stands for mitosis promoting factor.

Nitric oxide, arachidonic acid and steroids have been shown to play important roles in cell signaling. Figure 6-B-1. Signaling with NO or arachidonic acid. Unlike most signaling cascades which occur within the same cell, newly generated NO or arachidonic acid diffuses to act on target molecules in neighboring cells. Nitric oxide Nitric oxide (NO) is produced from the following reaction: where NOS represents NO synthase. After NO is generated in a cell, it diffuses to act on target molecules in neighboring cells. NO may stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP which regulates several enzymes and ion channels. In smooth muscle, an important action of cGMP is to induce muscle relaxation. Normally, cGMP will soon be converted into GMP by phosphodiesterase. The well known drug for impotence, Viagra (sildenafil citrate), inhibits phosphodiesterase. Figure 6-B-2. Structures of cAMP and cGMP. Arachidonic acid Arachidonic acid is generated from phospholipid hydrolysis catalyzed by phospholipase. Like NO, its target is usually not located in the cell where it was first generated. After diffusing to target cells, arachidonic acid may activate protein kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of target molecules. Many of its target molecules are involved in learning and other neuronal activities. Figure 6-B-3. Generation of arachidonic acid from phospholipid by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Steroids The major role of steroids is to regulate transcription, since many steroid receptors are transcription factors. Figure 6-B-4.

Steroid-bound SR may recruit SRC (steroid receptor coactivator) and histone acetyltransferases to stimulate transcription of the target gene (see also Figure 4-G-3).

        txtmod:sectionText     "Organism cloning (also called reproductive cloning) is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves the contribution of DNA from two individuals (parents), making it impossible to generate an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to reproductively clone mammals in the laboratory. Natural sexual reproduction involves the union, during fertilization, of a sperm and an egg. Each of these gametes is haploid, meaning they contain one set of chromosomes in their nuclei. The resulting cell, or zygote, is then diploid and contains two sets of chromosomes. This cell divides mitotically to produce a multicellular organism. However, the union of just any two cells cannot produce a viable zygote; there are components in the cytoplasm of the egg cell that are essential for the early development of the embryo during its first few cell divisions. Without these provisions, there would be no subsequent development. Therefore, to produce a new individual, both a diploid genetic complement and an egg cytoplasm are required. The approach to producing an artificially cloned individual is to take the egg cell of one individual and to remove the haploid nucleus. Then a diploid nucleus from a body cell of a second individual, the donor, is put into the egg cell. The egg is then stimulated to divide so that development proceeds. This sounds simple, but in fact it takes many attempts before each of the steps is completed successfully. Figure 9-I-1. Dolly the sheep was the first agricultural animal to be cloned. To create Dolly, the nucleus was removed from a donor egg cell. The enucleated egg was placed next to the other cell, then they were shocked to fuse. They were shocked again to start division. The cells were allowed to divide for several days until an early embryonic stage was reached, before being implanted in a surrogate mother. The first cloned agricultural animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for six years and died of a lung tumor. There was speculation that because the cell DNA that gave rise to Dolly came from an older individual, the age of the DNA may have affected her life expectancy. Since Dolly, several species of animals (such as horses, bulls, and goats) have been successfully cloned. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells. In the procedure, the DNA from an adult human is introduced into a human egg cell, which is then stimulated to divide. The technology is similar to the technology that was used to produce Dolly, but the embryo is never implanted into a surrogate mother. The cells produced are called embryonic stem cells because they have the capacity to develop into many different kinds of cells, such as muscle or nerve cells. The stem cells could be used to research and ultimately provide therapeutic applications, such as replacing damaged tissues. The benefit of cloning in this instance is that the cells used to regenerate new tissues would be a perfect match to the donor of the original DNA. For example, a leukemia patient would not require a sibling with a tissue match for a bone-marrow transplant.   [Source: OpenStax College.]  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "As the embryo forms, its overall body pattern is determined by the establishment of three clear axes—the anterior-posterior axis (head-tail), the dorsal-ventral (back-belly) axis, and left-right asymmetry. The establishment of these body axes at the correct time is fundamental to normal embryonic development. For instance, the central nervous system develops along the dorsal surface, with the largest concentration of neuronal tissue—the brain—at the anterior end of the embryo. The limbs develop symmetrically and bilaterally, whereas the heart—although it begins as a symmetrical structure—ultimately comes to point toward the left side of the trunk. Some internal structures are paired (the kidneys, lungs, adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries), whereas many are not (the heart, gut, pancreas, spleen, liver, and uterus). Information about the establishment of these body axes and their role in development is far from complete. For example, the anterior-posterior axis of the mouse blastocyst may be determined before it implants and is certainly established before gastrulation. An unanswered question, however, is whether this early embryonic axis helps determine the later development of the embryo. The early axis may play a role in primitive streak formation, and requires the expression of Wnt, which helps regulate the formation of one of embryo's chief signaling centers: the node. An important group of cells that produces molecular signals that help determine the anterior-posterior axis of the mouse embryo is the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). The AVE expresses different genes along its length. At embryonic day 5 (E5.0) in the mouse, for example, the Hex gene—a member of the family of homeobox genes that help regulate body patterning of the mouse embryo—is expressed in the distal visceral endoderm. These cells migrate to become the AVE, which forms on the opposite side of the embryo from the primitive streak, thus establishing the anterior-posterior axis of the fetus. Then, between E6.0 and E7.0 in the mouse, the anterior region of the AVE, where the heart will form, expresses Mrg1. The medial region expresses the transcription factor genes Otx2 and Lim1, as well as other genes. The region of the AVE that lies next to the part of the epiblast that will give rise to oral ectoderm and the forebrain expresses Hesx1, another homeobox gene. Collectively, the AVE and the genes it expresses help regulate the development of the anterior end of the embryo. Other genes, notably Bmp4, also help shape the mouse embryo prior to gastrulation. BMP stands for bone morphogenetic protein, a family of proteins that help regulate the differentiation of mesenchymal cells, which are derived from mesoderm, including bone-forming osteoblasts, and adipocytes, which are fat cells. They also play a role in CNS development. Bmp4, which is expressed in the extraembryonic ectoderm next to the epiblast and also in the inner cell mass of the E3.5 and E4.5 mouse blastocyst, may activate genes in epiblast cells that then migrate to form the primitive streak. Wnt3 apparently helps induce the formation of both the primitive streak and the node in mammals, although there is no evidence indicating that Wnt3 expression is required for mesoderm induction. However, formation of the embryo's head region, obviously a key anterior structure, seems to require inhibition of the activities of Wnt and Bmp4—a potential role of the AVE. Therefore, coordinating the embryo's \"decisions\" about its body pattern is a hierarchy of genes. Overall, the Hox genes specify anterior-posterior polarity. Their normal function can be subverted by retinoic acid, which can activate Hox genes in inappropriate places. Less is known about the establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis. It may be determined in the blastocyst, or even in the oocyte; it is clearly established when the notochord develops. Genes such as Nodal and Lefty help determine left-right asymmetry. Genes that regulate body patterning in embryonic development are well conserved throughout evolution among both vertebrates and invertebrates.   Source: U.S. National Institute of Health  " ;

As shown in the following figure, a typical DNA molecule consists of genes, pseudogenes and extragenic region. Pseudogenes are nonfunctional genes. They often originate from mutation of duplicated genes. Because duplicated genes have several copies, the organism can still survive even if a couple of them become nonfunctional. Figure 3-F-1.

The intertwined strands make two grooves of different widths, referred to as the major groove and the minor groove, which may facilitate binding with specific proteins. Figure 3-B-3.

The cis-regulatory elements are the binding sites of transcription factors which are the proteins that, upon binding with cis-regulatory elements, can affect (either enhance or repress) transcription. The trans-regulatory elements are the DNA sequences that encode transcription factors. The cis-acting elements may be divided into the following four types: Promoter The DNA element where the transcription initiation takes place. Enhancer The element that, upon binding with transcription factors, can enhance transcription. The transcription factors that bind to enhancers are called transcriptional activators. Silencer The element that, upon binding with transcription factors, can repress transcription. The transcription factors that bind to silencers are called repressors. Response element The recognition site of certain transcription factors. Figure 4-C-1. Gene organization. The transcription region consists of exons and introns. The regulatory elements include promoter, response element, enhancer and silencer (not shown). Downstream refers to the direction of transcription and upstream is opposite to the transcription direction. The numbering of base pairs in the promoter region is as follows. The number increases along the direction of transcription, with \"+1\" assigned for the initiation site. There is no \"0\" position. The base pair just upstream of +1 is numbered \"-1\", not \"0\".  " ;

After a peptide is synthesized, it may undergo a variety of modifications, including the cleavage of its N-terminus. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes use different mechanisms to recognize the initiating codon. Prokaryotes Many prokaryotic mRNAs are polycistronic, namely, an mRNA encodes more than one peptide chain. The polycistronic mRNA should contain multiple initiating codons. However, a peptide may also contain several non-initiating methionine residues. In the standard genetic code, the codon for both initiating and non-initiating methionine is AUG. To distinguish them, prokaryotes use a specific sequence located about 5-10 bases upstream of the initiation AUG. The specific sequence, UAAGGAGG, is known as the Shine-Dalgamo sequence (after its discoverers). The 16S rRNA of the ribosome contains a sequence which can pair with the Shine-Dalgamo sequence: 5'--UAAGGAGG(5-10 bases)AUG mRNA 3'--AUUCCUCC........ 16S rRNA Their association will recruit other parts of the ribosome to the initiation site for protein synthesis. Eukaryotes The mechanism used by eukaryotes to recognize the initiating AUG is not entirely clear. Evidence suggests that the eukaryotic ribosome may simply scan from the 5' cap and identify the first AUG as the initiation site. This mechanism is reasonable because nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs are monocistronic (encodes a single peptide). However, some viral mRNAs are polycistronic or lack 5' cap. It is not fully understood how the host eukaryotic cell recognizes the initiation sites of these viral mRNAs. Marilyn Kozak found that the following sequence may increase the effectiveness as an initiation site: 5'--ACCAUGG-        mRNA    " ;

Cycling of the Ras protein between active and inactive states. Like other G proteins, Ras can switch between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. Transition from the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound state is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which induces exchange between the bound GDP and the cellular GTP. The reverse transition is catalyzed by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) which induces hydrolysis of the bound GTP. Ras and cancer Mutations of the Ras proto-oncogenes (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras) are found in about 25% of all human tumors. Most of these mutations result in the abrogation of the normal GTPase activity of Ras. The Ras mutants can still bind to GAP, but cannot catalyze GTP hydrolysis. As a result, they remain in the active state for a much longer period. Malignant transformation may arise from the unregulated stimulation of Ras signaling pathways, which either stimulate cell growth or inhibit apoptosis.  " ;

For example, the covalent bond energy between two atoms ranges from 50 to 200 kcal/mol, which is far greater than the thermal energy (0.6 kcal/mol) at room temperature. Therefore, the covalent bond is unlikely to break in the absence of external interactions. Enzymes can provide a proper environment to lower the energy barrier. Figure 2-E-3. The free energy profile of an enzymatic reaction. The substrate S is the molecule on which an enzyme acts. P represents the reaction product. The horizontal axis (reaction coordinate) reflects the progressive change from S to P. The exact mechanism of lowering the energy barrier depends on individual systems. RNase A is a very interesting example. This enzyme can cleave an RNA molecule through hydrolysis reaction, but has no effect on DNA. In Chapter 3, we shall see that DNA and RNA differ by only one oxygen atom, which happens to play a critical role in the catalytic mechanism of RNase A. Figure 2-E-4.

(b) After the transition state is formed, the electron can move from His-119 to His-12, generating the final product. DNA lacks the critical 2'-OH and thus cannot be catalyzed by RNase A.  " ;

As discussed in Chapter 8 Section D, a stretch of DNA sequence may be copied to a different location through DNA recombination. After many generations, such sequence (the repeat unit) could spread over various regions. Mobile elements were first discovered by Barbara McClintock in 1940s from the studies of corn. Subsequently, they were found in all kinds of organisms. In mammals, the most common mobile elements are LINEs and SINEs. Table 3-G-1. Examples of mobile elements. LINEs LINEs stands for Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements. Its basic organization is shown below. Figure 3-G-2. Basic organization of LINEs. ORF1 and ORF2 are open reading frames. The protein product of ORF1 is called p40, with unknown function. ORF2 encodes a reverse transcriptase which is necessary for copying the element to other locations. The red color regions on both ends are direct repeats. All mobile elements contain direct repeats whose origin is explained in Chapter 8. Figure 3-G-3. Comparison between direct repeats and inverted repeats. Direct repeats have the same sequence along a given direction. Inverted repeats have complementary sequences along opposite directions. The most common LINEs in humans is the L1 family. A human genome contains about 60,000 to 100,1000 L1 elements. SINEs \"SINEs\" stands for Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements. Its length is about 300 bp. In humans, the most abundant SINEs is the Alu family. A human genome contains about 700,000 to 1,000,000 Alu sites. Although most LINEs and SINEs are located in extragenic regions, some of them are located in introns. For example, the human retinoblastoma gene (RB gene) is as long as 180 kb, consisting of 27 exons. Its introns contains many Alu and a few L1 elemtns.  " ;

The problem can be solved by three types of blotting methods: Southern blotting, Northern blotting and Western blotting. Southern Blotting Southern blotting is a technique for detecting specific DNA fragments in a complex mixture. The technique was invented in mid-1970s by Edward Southern. It has been applied to detect Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) Polymorphism. The latter is the basis of DNA fingerprinting. Figure 9-D-1. Southern blotting. (a) The DNA to be analyzed is digested with restriction enzymes and then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. (b) The DNA fragments in the gel are denatured with alkaline solution and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter or nylon membrane by blotting, preserving the distribution of the DNA fragments in the gel. (c) The nitrocellulose filter is incubated with a specific probe. The location of the DNA fragment that hybridizes with the probe can be displayed by autoradiography. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) Polymorphism refers to the DNA sequence variation between individuals of a species. If the sequence variation occurs at the restriction sites, it could result in RFLP. The most well known example is the RFLP due to β globin gene mutation. Figure 9-D-2. RFLP resulting from β-globin gene mutation. In the normal cell, the sequence corresponding to 5th to 7th amino acids of the β-globin peptide is CCTGAGGAG, which can be recognized by the restriction enzyme MstII. In the sickle cell, one base is mutated from A to T, making the site unrecognizable by MstII. Thus, MstII will generate 0.2 kb and 1.2 kb fragments in the normal cell, but generate 1.4 kb fragment in the sickle cell. These different fragments can be detected by the southern blotting. Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) Polymorphism VNTR may result from unequal crossover. It is the molecular basis of DNA fingerprinting which has many practical applications (see animations at Cold Spring Harbor Lab). Northern Blotting Northern blotting is used for detecting RNA fragments, instead of DNA fragments. The technique is called \"Northern\" simply because it is similar to \"Southern\", not because it was invented by a person named \"Northern\". In the Southern blotting, DNA fragments are denatured with alkaline solution. In the Northern blotting, RNA fragments are treated with formaldehyde to ensure linear conformation. Western Blotting Western blotting is used to detect a particular protein in a mixture. The probe used is therefore not DNA or RNA, but antibodies. The technique is also called \"immunoblotting\".  " ;

For instance, if the third nucleotide of Ser codon is mutated, the produced amino acid remains Ser. If the first nucleotide of Ser codon is mutated to A, it will produce Thr, which is similar to Ser. Such mutation will not have significant effect on the protein's structure and function. Let us consider a hypothetical case that codons are randomly assigned.

        txtmod:sectionText     "Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a method that identifies differences between individuals in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be involved in causing diseases. The method is particularly suited to diseases that may be affected by one or many genetic changes throughout the genome. It is very difficult to identify the genes involved in such a disease using linkage analysis. The GWAS method relies on a genetic database that has been in development since 2002 called the International HapMap Project. The HapMap Project sequenced the genomes of several hundred individuals from around the world and identified groups of SNPs. The groups include SNPs that are located near to each other on chromosomes so they tend to stay together through recombination. The fact that the group stays together means that identifying one marker SNP is all that is needed to identify all the SNPs in the group. There are several million SNPs identified, but identifying them in other individuals who have not had their complete genome sequenced is much easier because only the marker SNPs need to be identified. In a common design for a GWAS, two groups of individuals are chosen; one group has the disease, and the other group does not. The individuals in each group are matched in other characteristics to reduce the effect of confounding variables causing differences between the two groups. For example, the genotypes may differ because the two groups are mostly taken from different parts of the world. Once the individuals are chosen, and typically their numbers are a thousand or more for the study to work, samples of their DNA are obtained. The DNA is analyzed using automated systems to identify large differences in the percentage of particular SNPs between the two groups. Often the study examines a million or more SNPs in the DNA. The results of GWAS can be used in two ways: the genetic differences may be used as markers for susceptibility to the disease in undiagnosed individuals, and the particular genes identified can be targets for research into the molecular pathway of the disease and potential therapies. An offshoot of the discovery of gene associations with disease has been the formation of companies that provide so-called “personal genomics” that will identify risk levels for various diseases based on an individual’s SNP complement. The science behind these services is controversial. Because GWAS looks for associations between genes and disease, these studies provide data for other research into causes, rather than answering specific questions themselves. An association between a gene difference and a disease does not necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect relationship. However, some studies have provided useful information about the genetic causes of diseases. For example, three different studies in 2005 identified a gene for a protein involved in regulating inflammation in the body that is associated with a disease-causing blindness called age-related macular degeneration. This opened up new possibilities for research into the cause of this disease. A large number of genes have been identified to be associated with Crohn’s disease using GWAS, and some of these have suggested new hypothetical mechanisms for the cause of the disease.   [Source: OpenStax College]  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "Mutation refers to the change in a DNA sequence, which may involve only a few bases or the large-scale chromosome abnormality. This section covers the small-scale mutations (substitution, deletion, insertion) and the exon skipping that results from mutation at the splice site. The chromosome abnormality is discussed in Chapter 8 Section E. Substitution In the substitution mutation, one or more nucleotides are substituted by the same number of different nucleotides. In most cases, only one nucleotide is changed. Based on the change in the nucleotide type, the substitution mutation may be divided into transition and transversion mutations. Based on the consequence of mutation, the substitution mutation may be grouped into silent, missense and nonsense mutations. Figure 7-E-1. The substitution mutation. (a) Illustration of transition (blue) and transversion (red) mutations. In the transition mutation, a pyrimidine (C or T) is substituted by another pyrimidine, or a purine (A or G) is substituted by another purine. The transversion mutation involves the change from a pyrimidine to a purine, or vice versa. (b) Examples of silent, missense and nonsense mutations. The silent mutation does not produce any change in the amino acid sequence, the missense mutation results in a different amino acid, and the nonsense mutation generates a stop signal. Deletion The deletion mutation involves elimination of one or more nucleotides from a DNA sequence. It may cause frameshift, producing a non-functional protein. Figure 7-E-2. Real examples of deletion mutations which cause diseases. (a) Deletion of \"T\" from the sequence \"TTTTT\" in the CFTR gene. (b) Deletion of \"AT\" from the sequence \"ATAT\" in the CFTR gene. (c) Deletion of \"TTG\" from the sequence \"TTGTTG\" in the FIX gene. (d) Deletion of \"ATAG\" from the sequence \"ATAGATAG\" in the APC gene. Note that deletion and insertion mutations often occur in the repetitive sequence. As explained in the next section, they are usually caused by \"replication slippage\". Insertion In the insertion mutation, one or more nucleotides are inserted into a sequence. If the number of inserted bases is not a multiple of 3, it will cause frameshift, resulting in serious consequences. As shown in the following table, non-frameshift insertions may also cause diseases. Table 7-E-1. Examples of diseases caused by insertion mutation. Exon Skipping Figure 7-E-3. Example of exon skipping. Splicing of an intron requires an essential signal: \"GT........AG\". If the splice acceptor site AG is mutated (e.g., A to C in this figure), the splicing machinery will look for the next acceptor site. As a result, the exon between two introns is also removed.  " ;

Figure 8-D-2. The Holliday model of DNA crossover. (a) Two homologous DNA molecules line up (e.g., two nonsister chromatids line up during meiosis). (b) Cuts in one strand of both DNAs. (c) The cut strands cross and join homologous strands, forming the Holliday structure (or Holliday junction). (d) Heteroduplex region is formed by branch migration. (e) Resolution of the Holliday structure. Figure 8-D-2e is a different view of the Holliday junction than Figure 8-D-2d. DNA strands may be cut along either the vertical line or horizontal line. (f) The vertical cut will result in crossover between f-f' and F-F' regions. The heteroduplex region will eventually be corrected by mismatch repair. (g) The horizontal cut does not lead to crossover after mismatch repair. However, it could cause gene conversion. Figure 8-D-3. The structure of the RecA hexamer (PDB ID = 2REC), which can wrap around single-stranded DNA and direct it to form the Holliday structure. The detailed mechanism of homologous recombination was mainly obtained from the study of E. coli. Although bacteria do no undergo meiosis, homologous recombination could occur during or immediately after DNA replication. It may also occur in a mating process called conjugation. In E. coli, the recombination is initiated by the enzyme RecBCD, consisting of three subunits: RecB, RecC and RecD. This enzyme has both helicase and nuclease activities. The enzyme first uses its helicase activity to unwind DNA. When it hits the Chi site (with sequence GCTGGTGG), one of the exposed strand will be cut by its nuclease activity. The reason why this special site is called the \"Chi site\" is because the Greek letter χ (chi) looks like a crossover point. The Chi site is the position of the Holliday junction and also the position of chiasma. After DNA strands are cut by RecBCD, the strand invasion is catalyzed by RecA proteins, which can wrap around single stranded DNA and direct it to form the Holliday structure. Finally, the branch migration is catalyzed by RuvA and RuvB. The Holliday structure is resolved by the protein RuvC.  " ;

Most snRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II using the same mechanism as transcribing protein genes. Transcription by RNA Polymerase I RNA polymerase I is devoted to the synthesis of pre-rRNA. Like RNA polymerase II, a pre-initiation complex (PIC) has to be formed before RNA polymerase I can exert its function. The order of the PIC assembly is illustrated in Figure 4-I-1. Figure 4-I-1. The PIC assembly for RNA polymerase I. The regulatory region of pre-rRNA gene contains a core element and an upstream control element (UCE). Binding of two upstream binding factors (UBF) to both elements may induce DNA looping, and subsequently recruiting TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFI). Finally, RNA polymerase I joins the complex and completes the assembly process.

The stage between mitoses is called the interphase which covers the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle. During the G2 phase, DNA has been replicated and the chromosome number is 4n. In the interphase, chromosomes are not visible by light microscopy because the chromatin diffuses throughout the nucleus. Figure 8-B-1. Phases of mitosis. Mitosis may be divided into the following phases. Prophase: The chromatin condenses into chromosomes. Two centrioles move toward the opposite ends (poles) of the cell. Microtubules radiate from each centriole, forming a structure called \"spindle\". By the end of prophase, the nuclear envelope breaks down into small vesicles. Metaphase: The chromosomes align at the equatorial plane of the cell, as directed by the microtubules attached to the kinetochore (located at the centromere of each chromosome). Anaphase: Sister chromatids separate and move apart. The separation happens simultaneously for the entire set of chromosomes. The microtubules attached to the kinetochore also play a critical role in this process. Telophase: The chromosomes begin to uncoil and become less condensed. The spindle disappears while the nuclear envelope reappears. The cell elongates and eventually divides into two daughter cells. The process of cell division is called \"cytokinesis.\" The morphological changes in early mitosis are mainly due to the phosphorylation of related proteins catalyzed by MPF. The mitosis is terminated by the activation of DBRP.  " ;

H1 and its homologous protein H5 are involved in higher-order structures of chromatin. The other four types of histones associate with DNA to form nucleosomes. H1 (or H5) has about 220 residues. Other types of histones are smaller, each consisting of 100-150 residues. Figure 3-D-2. Each nucleosome consists of 146 bp DNA and 8 histones: two copies for each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.

Lysine residues (red color) at the N terminus play a major role in the regulation of gene transcription. An important feature about histones is that they contain a few lysine (K) residues at the N terminus. Under normal cellular conditions, the R group of lysine is positively charged, which can interact with the negatively charged phosphates in DNA. The positive R group of lysine may be neutralized by acetylation, reducing the binding force between histones and DNA. Such mechanism has been demonstrated to play a major role in the regulation of gene transcription (Chapter 4 Section G).  " ;

For example, the following DNA sequence is just a small part of telomere located at the ends of each human chromosome: An entire telomere, about 15 kb, is constituted by thousands of the repeated sequence \"GGGTTA\". DNA reassociation kinetics is used to classify the repetitive DNA sequences. The total DNA is first randomly cleaved into fragments with an average size of about 1000 bp. Then, they are heated to separate the complementary strands of each fragment. Subsequently, temperature is reduced to allow strand reassociation. If a fragment contains a sequence which is repeated many times in the total DNA, it will have greater chance to find a complementary strand and reassociate more quickly than other fragments with less repetitive sequences. Based on the reassociation rate, DNA sequences are divided into three classes: Highly repetitive: About 10-15% of mammalian DNA fragments reassociate very rapidly. This class includes tandem repeats. Moderately repetitive: Roughly 25-40% of mammalian DNA fragments reassociate at an intermediate rate. This class includes interspersed repeats (also known as mobile elements or transposable elements). Single copy (or very low copy number): This class accounts for 50-60% of mammalian DNA.  " ;

In prokaryotes, the sequence of a promoter is recognized by the sigma (σ) factor of the RNA polymerase. In eukaryotes, it is recognized by specific transcription factors. E. coli E. coli has five sigma factors: Sigma 70: Regulate expression of most genes. Sigma 32: Regulate expression of heat shock proteins. Sigma 28: Regulate expression of flagellar operon (involved in cell motion). Sigma 38: Regulate gene expression against external stresses. Sigma 54: Regulate gene expression for nitrogen metabolism. Table 4-C-1. E. coli σ factors and the consensus sequences of their recognition sites (promoters). Table 4-C-1 shows the consensus sequences of the promoters recognized by E. coli σ factors (except for Sigma 38 which is not clear). The consensus sequence is an ideal sequence for the interaction with its regulatory protein. A promoter should contain an element which is identical to or very close to the consensus sequence. Example: The lac operon promoter Eukaryotes In eukaryotes, there is a significant difference between the transcription of protein genes and RNA genes. Most sections in Chapter 4 are devoted to the transcription of protein genes. RNA genes are discussed in Section I. The most common promoter element in eukaryotic protein genes is the TATA box, located at -35 to -20. Its consensus sequence, TATAAA, is quite similar to the -10 region of the Sigma 70 recognition site. Another promoter element is called the initiator (Inr). It has the consensus sequence PyPyAN(T/A)PyPy, where Py denotes pyrimidine (C or T), N = any, and (T/A) means T or A. The base A at the third position is located at +1 (the transcriptional start site). TATA box and initiator are the core promoter elements. There are other elements often located within 200 bp of the transcriptional start site, such as CAAT box and GC box which may be referred to as promoter-proximal elements. Table 4-C-2. Eukaryotic promoter elements. The protein which interacts with the initiator and TATA box is known as the TATA-box binding protein (TBP), which recognizes not only the core promoter of protein genes, but also RNA promoters (Section I). It is a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID. In eukaryotes, transcription requires several different general transcription factors and, in most cases, the regulatory transcription factors. Example: the promoter region of the IL-2 gene, which contains TATA box and the binding sites of transcription factors, NFAT, Oct-1, NF-κB and AP-1.  " ;

(a) Structure of Sigma 70, residues 114 to 448. PDB ID = 1SIG. (b) A model for the binding between Sigma 70 and the promoter, based on biochemical studies. Residues Y425, Y430, W433 and W434 are directly involved in the unwinding (melting) of the double helix. Note that the promoter is rich in A and T. The AT pair involves two hydrogen bonds whereas the CG pair involves three hydrogen bonds. Therefore, AT pairs are easier to separate. The DNA replication origin is also rich in A and T. After the DNA strands are separated at the promoter region, the core polymerase (ααββ') can then start to synthesize RNA based on the sequence of the DNA template strand (see Figure 4-B-1). Since the role of the σ factor is mainly to initiate transcription, it will be released after about 10 ribonucleotides have been polymerized. Elongation of the RNA strand continues until the core polymerase reaches the termination site (more info).

In mammals, the expression of these necessary proteins is activated by the transcription factor E2F which, in turn, is regulated by the protein pRB (the protein product of the retinoblastoma gene). When pRB binds to E2F, it will inactivate the transcriptional function of E2F, thereby inhibiting DNA replication. With such a critical role, pRB is known as the \"master brake of cell division\". Figure 8-A-4. The Initiation and termination process of the S phase. During G0 or early G1 phase, E2F is inactivated by pRB. In late G1 phase, the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex phosphorylates a specific set of sites on pRB, resulting in the release of E2F, which then leads to the production of proteins needed for DNA replication. E2F also stimulates the production of Cyclin E, cyclin A and E2F itself. The Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex can also phosphorylate pRB, thus accelerating the cell cycle advance into the S phase. On the other hand, the Cyclin A-Cdk2 complex can phosphorylate E2F, abolishing its transcriptional function. Consequently, DNA replication is terminated. It is interesting to note that the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex cannot phosphorylate E2F. Otherwise, the DNA replication would be terminated prematurely.  " ;

In this section, we discuss first the processing of pre-mRNA and then processing of pre-rRNA and pre-tRNA. Processing of pre-mRNA involves the following steps: Capping - add 7-methylguanylate (m7G) to the 5' end. Polyadenylation - add a poly-A tail to the 3' end. Splicing - remove introns and join exons. In some cases, RNA editing is also involved. Figure 5-A-1. The procedure of RNA processing for protein genes. 5'-Capping Capping occurs shortly after transcription begins. The chemical structure of the \"cap\" is shown in the following figure, where m7G is linked to the first nucleotide by a special 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. In most organisms, the first nucleotide is methylated at the 2'-hydroxyl of the ribose. In vertebrates, the second nucleotide is also methylated. Figure 5-A-2. Modifications at the 5' end. 3'-Polyadenylation A stretch of adenylate residues are added to the 3' end. The poly-A tail contains ~ 250 A residues in mammals, and ~ 100 in yeasts. Figure 5-A-3. Polyadenylation at the 3' end. The major signal for the 3' cleavage is the sequence AAUAAA. Cleavage occurs at 10-35 nucleotides downstream from the specific sequence. A second signal is located about 50 nucleotides downstream from the cleavage site. This signal is a GU-rich or U-rich region. Processing of pre-rRNA and pre-tRNA The newly transcribed pre-rRNA is a cluster of three rRNAs: 18S, 5.8S and 28S in mammals. They must be separated to become functional. Pre-rRNA is synthesized in the nucleolus. The U3 snRNA, other U-rich snRNAs, and their associated proteins in the nucleolus are involved in the cleavage of the pre-rRNA. 5S rRNA is synthesized in the nucleoplasm. It does not require any processing. After 5S rRNA is synthesized, it will enter the nulceolus to combine with 28S and 5.8S rRNAs, forming the large subunit of the ribosome. Pre-tRNA requires extensive processing to become a functional tRNA. Four types of modifications are involved: Removing an extra segment (~ 16 nucleotides) at the 5' end by RNase P. Removing an intron (~ 14 nucleotides) in the anticodon loop by splicing. Replacing two U residues at the 3'end by CCA, which is found in all mature tRNAs. Modifying some residues to characteristic bases, e.g., inosine, dihydrouridine and pseudouridine.  " ;

The cI dimer may bind to any of three operators, OR1, OR2, and OR3, in the order OR1 > OR2 > OR3. Binding of a cI dimer to OR1 enhances binding of a second cI dimer to OR2. Thus, OR1 and OR2 are almost always simultaneously occupied by cI. However, this does not increase the affinity between cI and OR3, which will be occupied only when the cI concentration is high.

In the somatic cells of humans, the normal diploid number of chromosomes is 46 (23 pairs), but a germ cell (sperm or egg) contains only 23 chromosomes. Fusion between the sperm and egg restores the number of chromosomes to be the same as in a somatic cell. Prior to fertilization in humans and mice, the egg (oocyte) enlarges, divides by meiosis, and matures in its ovarian follicle until it reaches a stage of meiotic division called metaphase II. At this point, the follicle releases the oocyte into the oviduct, one of two tube-like structures that lead from the ovaries to the uterus. Acrosome Reaction The mature oocyte (ovum) is surrounded by a protective coat of non-cellular material called zona pellucida. To fertilize the egg, the sperm cell must bind to and penetrate the zona pellucida, fuse with the egg's cell membrane and enter its cytoplasm. The process of penetrating through the zona pellucida is called acrosome reaction. The acrosome is an organelle located at the anterior half of the head of a sperm cell. Figure 2-1. Acrosome reaction on a Sea Urchin cell. (Source: Wikipedia). Activation of the Egg Ca2+ ions play a central role in the amazing development from a single cell to an embryo, because many enzymes are calcium-dependent. In addition to chromosomes, the major ingredient in a sperm is an enzyme that can initiate the release of Ca2+ ions originally stored in the endoplasmic reticulum of the egg. Release of Ca2+ Ions Ca2+ ions are released through IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels located on the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum. In the absence of IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate), this type of Ca2+ channels are closed and the Ca2+ ions remain in the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon binding of IP3 molecules, the Ca2+ channels open and the Ca2+ ions can move from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol. IP3 can be generated by the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC) which splits a membrane phospholipid, PIP2 (phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate), into diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3. There are many types of PLC, each can be activated by different pathways. The PLC responsible for the release of Ca2+ ions in the egg is species-dependent. In mammals, it is the type PLC-ζ (zeta) from the sperm cytosol. It has been demonstrated that injection of the enzyme PLC-ζ into the human egg can induce calcium waves as seen in normal fertilization. Resumption of cell cycle Prior to fertilization, the egg is arrested at the metaphase II (MetII) of its meiotic division. The MetII arrest is maintained by high level of MPF (mitosis promoting factor), which consists of two components: Cyclin B and cyclin-dependent kinase. In the absence of Cyclin B, MPF is inactive. Ca2+ can stimulate the degradation of Cyclin B to resume the cell cycle. Rearrangement of egg cytoplasm After cell division, the daughter cells should have the same DNA sequences. Then, how can a fertilized egg produce many types of cells? The earliest cell differentiation arises from rearrangement of the egg cytoplasm so that different segments contain different proteins and RNAs that regulate gene expression. Although the daughter cells have the same DNA sequences, but they may have different gene regulators, thereby possessing different characteristics.   References: National Institute of Health, USA.

The uracil (U) of RNA can also pair with adenine (A), since U differs from T only by a methyl group located on the other side of hydrogen bonding. A DNA molecule has two strands, held together by the hydrogen bonding between their bases. As shown in the above figure, adenine can form two hydrogen bonds with thymine; cytosine can form three hydrogen bonds with guanine. Although other base pairs [e.g., (G:T) and (C:T) ] may also form hydrogen bonds, their strengths are not as strong as (C:G) and (A:T) found in natural DNA molecules. The following figure shows an example of base pairing between DNA's two strands. Figure 3-B-2. Schematic drawing of DNA's two strands. Due to the specific base pairing, DNA's two strands are complementary to each other. Hence, the nucleotide sequence of one strand determines the sequence of another strand. For example, in Figure 3-B-2, the sequence of the two strands can be written as 5' -ACT- 3' 3' -TGA- 5' Note that they obey the (A:T) and (C:G) pairing rule. If we know the sequence of one strand, we can deduce the sequence of another strand. For this reason, a DNA database needs to store only the sequence of one strand. By convention, the sequence in a DNA database refers to the sequence of the 5' to 3' strand (left to right).  " ;

Once inside the cell, the normal gene can make functional protein to treat a disease (Figure 10-C-1).

Examples of deamination which involves the removal of an amino group. Accidental deamination may change the cytosine to uracil, or the methylated cytosine to thymine. Cytosine is one of four bases in DNA molecules. As shown in the above figure, it may be mutated to uracil by deamination. Since uracil is not part of DNA, this mutation can easily be detected and repaired by base excision. Suppose DNA, like RNA, were made up of uracil, then the cytosine to uracil mutation could be corrected only by mismatch repair which is very inefficient. This may explain why DNA chooses thymine, instead of uracil, even though the chemical structure of uracil is simpler than thymine.  " ;

Germ cells (egg and sperm) are produced by meiosis. Figure 8-C-1. Illustration of meiosis. The meiosis involves two consecutive cell divisions. Each division is composed of four stages as in mitosis. However, the first division differs in two important aspects: In the metaphase I, each pair of sister chromatids aligns with its homologous pair side by side, forming two lines of sister chromatids at the equatorial plane (there is only one line in mitosis). Such alignment is called synapsis. In the subsequent anaphase I, each pair of sister chromatids moves away from its homologous pair, but the sister chromatids are not separated. After the first division, the chromosome number in each daughter cell becomes 2n. The process of the second division is the same as in mitosis except that there is no DNA replication during the interphase. As a result, the produced cell is a haploid (1n). During synapsis, DNA recombination may occur between homologous pairs of sister chromatids. Details are given in Section D. Independent Assortment In the metaphase I of meiosis, two pairs of homologous sister chromatids align side by side. One pair (the maternal homolog) comes from the egg and another pair (the paternal homolog) comes from the sperm. Subsequently, the two homologous pairs are separated into two different daughter cells. Since they are randomly aligned, which homolog will enter which daughter cell is random. As a result, each daughter cell will contain some maternal homologs and some paternal homologs. For human cells, there are a total of 8.4 million (= 223) possible combinations. Figure 8-C-2. Illustration of independent assortment. Sperm cells (1n) come from the meiotic division of primary spermatocytes (2n). In their 23 chromosomes, some of them (pink) are inherited from the maternal homolog and others (blue) are from the paternal homolog.

Its promoter sequence is shown in the following figure. Figure 4-C-2. The lac operon promoter ( which regulates the transcription of lacZ, not lacI). The DNA's two strands are complementary to each other. Only one strand's sequence is sufficient to represent both strands' information. By convention, the sequence of the 5' to 3' strand (from left to right) is used. In the above figure, the promoter sequence of the lac operon is TATGTT at the -10 region, and TTTACA at the -35 region. From Table 4-C-1, the consensus sequence of σ70 which regulates the lac operon is TATAAT at the -10 region, and TTGACA at the -35 region. They differ at three positions (two at the -10 region and one at the -35 region). Experimentally, it has been found that binding of the RNA polymerase to the lac promoter is relatively weak. Transcription of the lac operon often requires an activator such as catabolite activator protein (CAP).  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "The life cycle of viruses may be divided into the following stages: 1. Attachment Attachment is a specific binding between viral surface proteins and their receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks only human's immune cells (mainly T cells), because its surface protein, gp120, can interact with CD4 and chemokine receptors on the T cell's surface (Figure 1-E-3). 2. Penetration Following attachment, viruses may enter the host cell through receptor mediated endocytosis or other mechanisms. 3. Uncoating Uncoating is a process that the viral capsid is degraded by viral enzymes or host enzymes. 4. Replication Replication involves assembly of viral proteins and genetic materials produced in the host cell. 5. Release Viruses may escape from the host cell by causing cell rupture (lysis). Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically \"bud\" from the host cell. During the budding process, a virus acquires the phospholipid envelope containing the embedded viral glycoproteins.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "DNA replication is triggered by the expression of all required proteins, such as DNA polymerase, DNA primase, and cyclin. In yeast, the transcription factor regulating the expression of these proteins is called MCB binding factor. In mammals, the corresponding transcription factor is E2F. Table 7-A-1. Genes regulated by the yeast MCB binding factor. Gene transcription starts from the promoter, proceeding along one direction, whereas the DNA replication starts from the replication origin, proceeding along both directions. There is only one replication origin in the genomic DNA of E. coli (Figure 3-H-3), but the eukaryotic DNA contains many replication origins in each chromosome. Figure 7-A-1. Schematic drawing of the DNA replication process. O1, O2, and O3 are replication origins, each serving a region called replicon (R1, R2, and R3). DNA replication involves unwinding of the double helix. New strands are synthesized by DNA polymerases using the old strands as template. Unwinding of a DNA molecule looks like a \"fork\" growing in one direction. The region being replicated looks like a bubble called the \"replication bubble\" (in red). In E. coli, movement of the growing fork is about 1000 bp per second. It takes about 42 minutes to duplicate the entire genomic DNA. In eukaryotic DNA, the fork movement is only about 100 bp per second. This is probably due to the association of DNA with histones, which may hinder the fork movement. In humans, replication of the entire genome requires about 8 hours. In fruit flies, it takes only 3 - 4 minutes. Figure 7-A-2. Sequences of bacterial and yeast replication origins. (a) The bacterial replication origin contains three homologous 13-mers and four homologous 9-mers. (b) The yeast replication origin is called autonomously replicating sequence (ARS). The \"A\" region is absolutely necessary, while B1, B2, and B3 can increase the replication efficiency. Based on computer analysis, the consensus sequence of human replication origin is WAWTTDDWWWDHWGWHMAWTT, where W = A or T; D = A, G or T ; H = A, C or T, and M = A or C. Note that \"A\" and \"T\" dominate the replication origin. This is because the A-T pair is linked by two hydrogen bonds while C-T pair by three hydrogen bonds (Figure 3-B-1). Therefore, the region dominated by \"A\" and \"T\" should be easier to unwind.  " ;

        txtmod:sectionText     "In eukaryotes, there are three classes of RNA polymerases: I, II and III. This section will focus on the RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which is involved in the transcription of all protein genes. Transcription by RNA Pol I and Pol III is discussed in Section I. Figure 4-E-1. Structure of the human TBP core domain complexed with DNA as determined by x-ray crystallography. The DNA includes the TATA element. PDB ID = 1CDW. Initiation RNA Pol II does not contain a subunit similar to the prokaryotic σ factor, which can recognize the promoter and unwind the DNA double helix. In eukaryotes, these two functions are carried out by a set of proteins called general transcription factors. The RNA Pol II is associated with six general transcription factors, designated as TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH, where \"TF\" stands for \"transcription factor\" and \"II\" for the RNA Pol II. TFIID consists of TBP (TATA-box binding protein) and TAFs (TBP associated factors). The role of TBP is to bind the core promoter (Figure 4-E-1). TAFs may assist TBP in this process. In human cells, TAFs are formed by 12 subunits. One of them, TAF250 (with molecular weight 250 kD), has the histone acetyltransferase activity, which can relieve the binding between DNA and histones in the nucleosome. The transcription factor which catalyzes DNA melting is TFIIH. However, before TFIIH can unwind DNA, the RNA Pol II and at least five general transcription factors (TFIIA is not absolutely necessary) have to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC). The order of the PIC assembly is described in Figure 4-E-2. Elongation After PIC is assembled at the promoter, TFIIH can use its helicase activity to unwind DNA. This requires energy released from ATP hydrolysis. The DNA melting starts from about -10 bp. Then, RNA Pol II uses nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to synthesize a RNA transcript. During RNA elongation, TFIIF remains attached to the RNA polymerase, but all of the other transcription factors have dissociated from PIC. The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA Pol II is critical for elongation. In the initiation phase, CTD is unphosphorylated, but during elongation it has to be phosphorylated. This domain contains many proline, serine and threonine residues. Termination Eukaryotic protein genes contain a poly-A signal located downstream of the last exon. This signal is used to add a series of adenylate residues during RNA processing. Transcription often terminates at 0.5 - 2 kb downstream of the poly-A signal, but the mechanism is unclear. The role of regulatory transcription factors In early 1990s, when the mystery of transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes have been largely unveiled, scientists still knew very little about the regulation mechanism in eukaryotes. The breakthrough came in 1996 when a number of research groups discovered that certain transcriptional coactivators are histone acetyltransferases (HATs). It has been known for some time that binding of transcriptional activators to the enhancer region, in most cases, is not sufficient to stimulate transcription. Certain co-activators are also required. Similarly, transcriptional repression often requires both repressor binding on the silencer element and the participation of co-repressor proteins. The precise role of these co-activators and co-repressors was not clear until 1996. In eukaryotes, the association between DNA and histones prevents access of the polymerase and general transcription factors to the promoter. Histone acetylation catalyzed by HATs can relieve the binding between DNA and histones. Although a subunit of TFIID (TAF250 in human) has the HAT activity, participation of other HATs can make transcription more efficient. The following rules apply to most (but not all) cases: Binding of activators to the enhancer element recruits HATs to relieve association between histones and DNA, thereby enhancing transcription. Binding of repressors to the silencer element recruits histone deacetylases (denoted by HDs or HDACs) to tighten association between histones and DNA. For more information, see Section G.  " ;
