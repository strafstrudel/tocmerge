Observations on interleaving two Mol Bio TOCs.
Disclaimer: based on visual scan of the two TOCs without deep analysis or examination of underlying text

    The two texts seem organized somewhat differently
        MoBio is the classic textbook organization: first we discuss the structures, then we talk about how they work together in the functions
        WikiBook seems more focused on genetic material and its processing into proteins, in a more functional narrative - interleaving structure and function in the processing order of DNA -> RNA -> Protein
            That is, after an initial introductory chapter that includes both basic chemistry and cells (and after a somewhat oddly placed top-level chapter on the nucleus in particular), it launches right into "what it does" with the Cell Cycle (process), DNA (structure), DNA Replication (process), RNA (structure), RNA (process), etc.
    We take "MoBio" as the "backbone" for these reasons:
        The number of cases where near-perfect section matches are of a higher / more general level.
            Principle: when learning, it is easier to proceed from more general to more specific.
            Examples:
                MoBio "Protein [Structure and Function]" is top-level #2; WikiBook "Proteins" is 4th level 111.2
                MoBio "Prokaryotic Cells" is 3rd level 1A2; Wikibook "Prokaryotes" is 4th level 133.1
                MoBio "DNA Recombination" is 2nd level 8D; Wikibook "DNA Recombination" is 3rd level 512
                There are counterexamples, but I think the preponderance of (diffs * magnitude) indicates MoBio is more general
                Furthermore, the MoBio TOC hierarchy is only 3 levels deep.  WikiBook TOC hierarchy is several more levels deep.
        The organization of MoBio as classic "first structure, then function"
            Principle: this is a classic teaching (and for that matter ontic) structuring technique - teach some about the entity, then some about what it does (then iterate between more on what it is & what it does)
            Could a text analyzer help determine which sections were more about structure vs more about function (e.g. by looking for active forms of verbs for the latter?)
    On ordering sections, could text analysis help ensure that new / jargon terminology is introduced on a gradient, i.e.
        That words are defined the first time they are used (sometimes different text formatting is used for definition text)
        That new / jargon / technical words used with more frequency in subsequent chapters have been used in previous chapters with less frequency
